I agree with some of what you are saying-- stating that 'we are programmed
<br>
to believe we are conscious' is just deferring the problem. My immediate
<br>
subjective experience is bounded, but there is no boundary in terms of my
<br>
brains physical interaction with its immediate environment. different
<br>
cortices interact with each other, different systems in my body interact
<br>
with each other, my body interacts with its environment. There is no region
<br>
where interaction with its immediately surrounding regions cease. Yet
<br>
consciousness is bounded. We are not all aware of the entire universe as an
<br>
immediate subjective experience.
<br>
<p>Ah, you will likely say, but only some interaction is relevant, others are
<br>
just viewable as random thermal noise. This is probably true, so it may make
<br>
sense to think about information as a possible substrate of consciousness.
<br>
-- Its intuitively satisfying, at a primordial level, all we're really aware
<br>
of is information.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I know there would be no difference if I am conscious or

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; therefore it doesn't matter to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So your definition of consciousness is that which distinguishes you from

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or you mean that consciousness is detectable, but we just don't know how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detect it yet? Or we just don't know how to describe what it is because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we haven't thought about the problem hard enough?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps you can argue, like Penrose, that the brain does something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not computable. But most of us believe that the brain is made up of atoms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that obey the laws of physics, and we know that physics is computable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or maybe another explanation is that animals that didn't fear most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things that could kill them didn't pass on those genes to their offspring.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humans, being intelligent, learned about death and labeled that thing that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguishes living humans from everything else as &quot;consciousness&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; naturally have a very strong desire to preserve it. So that thing that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just *know* has to exist is really just a strong belief that all humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; share.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So the question is, if a machine is programmed to behave just like you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including being programmed to express this strong belief, is it you? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question is which side of this machine do you draw the line that separates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living humans from everything else?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or maybe it's just an imaginary line.
