This reminds me a great deal of an in depth interview in OMNI some years 
<br>
ago(obviously before omni went bellyup(obligitory sadness here).
<br>
<p>A man who had the idea for self replicating macroscale robots, whose primary 
<br>
product would be solar panels, with a chosen environment of a desert, 
<br>
preferably the interior of a large one. (africa springs to mind).
<br>
<p>The robots would use a chemical seperation process to obtain raw materials, 
<br>
and utilyze the electricity from the solar panels at a net gain, until the 
<br>
fraction surplus was sufficient, then the robotnetwork would broadcast it's 
<br>
status, and the entire power output could be used as a marketable resource, 
<br>
the only investments being design and fielding of the seed robots, and a 
<br>
large open space (deserts being good for clear skies, hot days, and few 
<br>
inhabitants.
<br>
<p>the article went into some detail as to the processes inherent to building 
<br>
general robots, and the design space required. a few years ago, i remembed 
<br>
the article(having read it as a child) and realizing the massive import of 
<br>
it, tried to find it. I've failed. Does anyone out there have an OMNI 
<br>
archive? is there one somewhere? all online sources are dead and have no 
<br>
text available. that I am aware of.
<br>
<p>Sorry, a little offtopic, but I think the concept is important, and this 
<br>
person may still be out there working on it.

<em>&gt;Santa's Workshop
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by Dani Eder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;v0.2,  26 March 2002
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Abstract:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An automated factory that can make copies of itself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a short (~1 year) time and can switch to making useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;products would have major implications for mankind's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;future.  From a finite input to produce the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factory, a growing and infinite stream of products
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could be produced.  NASA studied the feasibility of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;such a factory in 1980, but the computer power to run
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it was not available then.  It is now.  A start is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;made at re-examining the concept and the issues it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raises
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-----------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NASA studied the idea of a self-reproducing factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over 20 years ago (1) in the context of future space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;missions.  In that context, transportation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive.  Therefore it makes sense to send a 'seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factory' to a destination such as the Moon or an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asteroid.  The seed makes copies of itself, which then
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to reproduce exponentially until you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;desired number of factories.  They then switch to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;producing whatever product you wanted large quantities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of in the first place.  The estimated computer power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to run the factory, ~2GB memory and ~30GB storage, was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;way out of reach then, and the concept received no
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further attention.   Such computer power is well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within the reach of desktop PCs today, so it is time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to reconsider the concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The NASA study was limited in scope in several areas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Only factories in space were considered due to NASA's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;area of interest.  If such a factory can be built in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space, it should also be possible to build one on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Earth.  In fact, it should be easier since we already
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know a lot more about designing machines to work here
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on Earth.  In addition to ignoring Earthbound
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factories, the factory design in the study merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;produced copies of itself on the Moon to show the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;feasibility of reproduction.  The study did not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;address what useful products the factory would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;eventually make, nor did it address the idea of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starting with a simplified seed factory that uses a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;subset of the machines and processes that later
</em><br>
<em>&gt;generations of factories could use.  The study assumed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the sake of analysis production of 100% of it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own parts and 100% automated operation.  In a real
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world system less than 100% values may make economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense, especially for a factory on Earth.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limitations in the original study should be addressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by future work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The reproduction time of the factory on the Moon was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;estimated at about 1 year.  If a reproducing factory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can be built on Earth, it should have approximately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the same reproduction time:  Less raw sunlight is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;available on Earth for the solar panels producing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power, but the computer components will likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bought rather made, eliminating the whole electronics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manufacturing sector of the lunar factory.  From an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;economic standpoint, 100% compound growth is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;phenomenal return rate.  After a factory has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproduced enough times, mass quantities of goods can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be produced cheaply, hence the title of this article.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For example, a seed factory that runs on 100 KW of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solar panels is allowed to reproduce for 30 years.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You now have 1 billion factories with a power output
</em><br>
<em>&gt;100,000 GW, roughly 50 times the total electric output
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the planet today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There are a number of additional questions and issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that should be addressed in future analysis of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concept:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(A)  Does a self-replicating factory have inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advantages over the industrial complex we have on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Earth with many specialized but physically distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factories?  By co-locating the factory components you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;can cut transportation costs and automate the transfer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;betweeen components.  On the other hand you lose the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;benefits of resources (sunlight, ores) that are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concentrated in certain locations on Earth than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(B)  Is there a simpler subset of machines and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processes for the 'seed factory' that can then build
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rest of the machines in the later generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factories?  For example, could you start with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;milling machine, a mobile robot with an assortment of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hand-tool attachments, a solar panel, and a pile of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;raw stock and proceed to make additional types robots,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;machine tools, etc.  What would be the optimal growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategy for such a seed factory?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(C) What is the optimum fraction of self-replication?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It may make sense to buy hard-to-make components (like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer processors and hard disks) rather than making
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them internally.  Even a fully automated factory can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order parts over the internet and have them delivered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as needed, and sell and ship products as needed to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for it's purchases.  The UPS guy may wonder, however,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why there are no cars in the parking lot.  A related
</em><br>
<em>&gt;issue is how reliable the equipment needs to be vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;maintenance overhead and the need to complete &gt;1 set
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of new equipment before the original equipment wears
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out to sustain reproduction and growth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(D) What are the economic and social implications of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fast factory reproduction?  If you own the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factory, you could end up owning a major fraction of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world's economic output.  Of course, automation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being introduced progressively into non-replicating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factories too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(E) How do you analyze, design, and simulate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;production process?  Like any mass-produced item,  the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factories would benefit in cost from designing it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;once, then producing many copies.  Determining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimum amount of effort to spend on design may be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;challenge.  If the factories grow in number faster
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than the discount rate you are using for economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analysis, then the present value of the future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;factories is very large.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(F) Does it make sense start with a partially
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reproducing and/or partially automated factory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;progressively improve it?  How will such an evolving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system interact with the rest of the world’s economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system, which is also evolving towards greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt;automation?
