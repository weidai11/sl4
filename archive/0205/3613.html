Hi Justin,
<br>
<p>I'm sure there are big individual differences between individual cognitive
<br>
styles, and that these are to some extent rooted in physiological
<br>
differences.
<br>
<p>For instance, I'm a bit synesthetic: I tend to see sounds and smells.  I
<br>
can't hear a melody with out seeing it too, at least in a kind of
<br>
multicolored ghostly afterimage type of way.  As a result I also often hear
<br>
&quot;visual imagery&quot; in my mind, even very abstract imagery that is only visual
<br>
in some odd multidimensional sense.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I have some thoughts that just appear in no way at all
<br>
sensorially connected to me. They feel like pure thought-forms.  I can't
<br>
even hear them.
<br>
<p>In &quot;The Psychology of Mathematical Invention&quot;, Hadamard discusses interviews
<br>
he did with a buttload of great mathematicans, discussing the nature of
<br>
their thought processes.  A lot of visual thinkers, some linguistic
<br>
thinkers, some non-sensory-image thinkers.  The one I remember vividly is
<br>
George Polya, who claimed to think mostly in terms of grunts like &quot;Uh&quot; ...
<br>
&quot;ah&quot; ... &quot;ooh&quot;  and so forth. Very fucking weird!!!
<br>
<p>To me what this says about AGI is that there are a lot of different ways to
<br>
skin a cat.  The perception/action/cognition interface is important, but
<br>
there may be a lot of different ways to implement this interface, and still
<br>
have functional general intelligence.  There is so much diversity even in
<br>
how various *human* minds work in this regard...

<em>&gt; Subject: RE: Review of Novamente &amp; a2i2
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In case it wasn't evident from context, this message was intended for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe so, but it does raise an interesting point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See, I've always been perplexed by something. Most people seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and categorize concepts and thought-complexes(what most people jargonize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into meme-plexes or paradigms) very very differently than I do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was on the sidelines for this exchange wondering to myself what Eliezer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would make of the fact that I spend much of my life with a 'silent' mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There aren't any named concepts or thought streams running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through my head.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just virtual-kinesthetic feelings. It's only when I switch on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of as my analytic mind (or occasionally I turn on an internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrator for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preciseness) that the inside of my head gets noisy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have repeatable used concepts that I can't think about in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confusing myself. For example, (I have to kind of explain around this, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bear with me) in some situations a certain confluence of factors (people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities, objects) give a 'directionality'(for lack of a better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term, to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; events around me. I've learned to rely on this directionality in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skew social dynamics in my preferred direction. Strangely, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best metaphor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can come up with is the way I can sense intent when sparring or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with someone(particularly kendo and fencing).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This feeling actually had me convinced for a while that I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychic(embarrassing experiments in my early teens to follow).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other people don't seem to have structures like this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet others have structures that I have difficulty understanding. I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend that can't think about music without categorizing it by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's 'shape'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Most Bach materializes as green polyhedrons, apparently) I have another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend who has internal invented words for smells!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This sort of variance in internal thought life really creeps me out, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes me think that introspection on the subject of cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; science may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really really wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some time ago now(yipes I'm getting old, nostalgia, run! ) I devised a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metric for determining internal cognitive process based on some simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selectors. It was intended to be plugged into customized learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protocols
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had designed. Some of the learning tests was surprisingly effective. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had kids speaking russian and italian way ahead of median
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning curves,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I broke several people's problems with learning advanced geometry. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't exactly had new Euclids running around, but it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impressive to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investors, anyway.(One of the test cases was an investor's kid who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beforehand had been flunking algebra I)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we learned from our experiments is that Internal modeling of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is sometimes bizarrely varied between people, and that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modeling of said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts is often a bottleneck in learning. Translation is a bitch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of our more repeatable conclusions is that the best 'generalized'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learners were those who could use generic mental structures to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the greatest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect. Particularly those who used mental object analogy, and visual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorization specifically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyways, didn't mean to ramble too much, but this kind of plugs into the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wordless concept debate here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -I did at one point have a bit of investor money lined up for an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental accelerated learning program for a small sample population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on my research, and some example projects the team had.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -Yes, I did this in high school. I was frustrated by my lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some areas, and originally approached this as a self improvement project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that snowballed. I unfortunately was never able to helpfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; categorize my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own mental gymnastics. So my learning is as slow as ever. I still believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that if I could get someone competent trained in the system I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate profile could be designed, and my various learning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disabilities and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disconnects could be corrected, But in the meantime, tough cookies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -I apologize to anyone I've been corresponding to, and the people who've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been getting emotional and nonsensical emails, or none at all. I'm in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; midst of kind of a familial tragedy, and most of my projects and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspondence have been derailed. (which is probably also why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm rambling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about one of my most beloved and failed attempts.)(Spectacular failure,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, Questions to Ponder:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Do these mental-object differences imply significant neuroanatomical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences between people? (we never really investigated it, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the expertise or the time. We were more about what worked, than why)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    1A. Does that matter at all, if it does?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. What impact on artificial minds does this difference entail?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   2A. Are these neccesary differences, or can they be ignored?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   2B. Do these differences convey significant advantages in cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing that an artifical minds may take advantage of?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One more thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am quite perplexed by your notion that concepts need to be *named* to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't you believe in content-addressable memory???
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is one of the design principles that Novamente inherits from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attractor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; neural nets (ANN's), actually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Semantic nets, which you dislike, involve addressing concepts by name.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ANN's involve addressing concepts by *specifying part of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contents* or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *specifying a collection of related entities*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In Novamente (an integrative design), *some* concepts are addressable by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; name, but *all* concepts are addressable ANN-style (because concepts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; represented by &quot;maps&quot;, which are much like attractors in ANN's).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
