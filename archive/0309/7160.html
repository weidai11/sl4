We're going off topic, but there was a nice feature in New Scientist on 
<br>
this recently:
<br>
<p>To sleep, perchance to dream
<br>
New Scientist vol 178 issue 2401 - 28 June 2003, page 28
<br>
(plus two sidebar articles)
<br>
--------------------------------------------------------
<br>
In the year that Everest was conquered and DNA's structure discovered, a 
<br>
young PhD student called Eugene Aserinsky did what no one had thought to 
<br>
do before. He spent hours staring at the eyelids of a sleeping person. 
<br>
What he saw was amazing. Instead of the slow periodic motion he'd been 
<br>
expecting, he saw frantic, jerky eye movements.
<br>
<p>Until then, sleep had been seen as a pretty passive and uninteresting 
<br>
state of mind. But Aserinsky and his PhD adviser, physiologist Nathaniel 
<br>
Kleitman of the University of Chicago, went on to show that this &quot;rapid 
<br>
eye movement&quot; was correlated with massively increased brain activity and 
<br>
dreaming. Their discovery is widely regarded as having kick-started the 
<br>
modern discipline of sleep research.
<br>
<p>Fifty years of intense study later, however, and almost every aspect of 
<br>
sleep remains a mystery. We still don't know what sleep is for, how it 
<br>
evolved, or why we dream. But there are exciting new ideas.
<br>
<p>Earlier this month, the city of Chicago hosted the biggest ever 
<br>
gathering of sleep researchers to mark the 50th anniversary of the 
<br>
discovery of REM, and to ask again, what is it all for? Graham Lawton 
<br>
reports.
<br>
<p>MOST PEOPLE think they don't get enough of it. Some manage just fine on 
<br>
half the usual amount. Dolphins do it with half a brain at a time. Rats 
<br>
die after three weeks without it, yet male Emperor penguins manage an 
<br>
entire three months of brooding without getting any. It's as good as 
<br>
ubiquitous among animals - even insects do it. We spend a third of our 
<br>
lives at it. Yet no one has any clue why we do it or how it came about.
<br>
<p>Our ignorance about sleep is becoming something of an embarrassment. Try 
<br>
to think of another fundamental biological phenomenon to which we can't 
<br>
assign a role. You'll draw a blank. &quot;I think it's the biggest unanswered 
<br>
question in neuroscience,&quot; says Craig Heller, a sleep researcher at 
<br>
Stanford University in California.
<br>
<p>Our ignorance does not stem from lack of trying. There are dozens of 
<br>
theories of sleep function out there, which fall into four broad 
<br>
classes: restoration and recovery, predator avoidance, energy 
<br>
conservation and information processing. Most sleep researchers are 
<br>
happy to accept that sleep has more than one function and that several 
<br>
of these theories, or perhaps all of them, are simultaneously correct. 
<br>
And yet not one of them has been confirmed or refuted. Take &quot;restoration 
<br>
and recovery&quot;, for example. This is probably the most obvious potential 
<br>
function of sleep and surely the easiest to test. Yet we still don't 
<br>
know what the brain might be restoring, or how.
<br>
<p>Why is sleep such a hard nut to crack? One big stumbling block has been 
<br>
its dual nature. While we sleep, we cycle between two very different 
<br>
states (see Diagram). The first is called slow wave sleep because it is 
<br>
characterised by long, lazy waves of undulating electrical activity 
<br>
(delta waves) that seem to be synchronised across the whole brain. The 
<br>
second is rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, as Aserinsky first witnessed, 
<br>
and it could hardly be more different. REM sleep is characterised by 
<br>
frantic brain activity that looks very much like wakefulness on an EEG 
<br>
trace. It also has very obvious physical signs: the rapid flickering 
<br>
motion of the eyeballs, the near-total muscle paralysis thought to 
<br>
prevent you acting out your dreams, and penile erections (women exhibit 
<br>
engorgement of the clitoris and lubrication of the vagina).
<br>
<p>REM sleep appears to have arisen quite early in evolution - reptiles, 
<br>
birds and mammals all do it. It's also a very active and excitable 
<br>
state. So it must serve a very useful function. Any decent theory of 
<br>
what sleep is for must account for it. In fact, explaining REM has so 
<br>
far dominated sleep research (so much so that slow wave sleep, despite 
<br>
having several distinct stages or depths is often defined merely as 
<br>
non-REM sleep). Yet the function of REM has proved so difficult to 
<br>
fathom that some sleep researchers despair that we will ever solve the 
<br>
problem. &quot;REM sleep has a biological function but we have not been able 
<br>
to find it. And I don't think there will be any explanation for another 
<br>
50 years,&quot; says Michel Jouvet, a veteran sleep researcher from the 
<br>
medical school at the University of Lyon in France, who has spent 48 
<br>
years studying REM sleep.
<br>
<p>While plenty of researchers are still busy studying REM and dreaming 
<br>
(see Box, &quot;What dreams are made of&quot;), in the past few years a new 
<br>
generation of sleep function theories have emerged that relegate REM to 
<br>
the background and say that non-REM is what sleep is all about. In these 
<br>
theories, REM sleep is a mere handmaiden of non-REM sleep and its 
<br>
function is to give the brain a break from, or perhaps even test and 
<br>
modify, the really crucial activity that is going on during non-REM 
<br>
sleep. Can this new generation of ideas finally crack the problem?
<br>
<p>One such theory has been developed by Heller. Some six years ago, he 
<br>
noticed something odd about the electrical activity of the brain during 
<br>
non-REM sleep. Looking closely at an EEG, he saw brief and subtle 
<br>
patterns of activity that looked like aborted transitions into REM. Such 
<br>
episodes, he found, happen increasingly often until the brain eventually 
<br>
swaps entirely into REM sleep. In other words, the pressure to enter REM 
<br>
sleep seems to build up through a bout of non-REM until the brain can no 
<br>
longer hold it back.
<br>
<p>This, Heller says, is a potentially revolutionary observation. Most 
<br>
theories of sleep control posit an external master switch that flips the 
<br>
sleeping brain from one state to another on a preordained timetable (the 
<br>
classic 90-minute cycle). Both states of sleep then have plenty of time 
<br>
to get on with their respective functions. But the build-up of aborted 
<br>
transitions to REM suggests that something else controls the change. 
<br>
It's as if non-REM creates the need for REM sleep - just as wakefulness 
<br>
eventually creates pressure to snooze. Further support for this idea 
<br>
comes from the fact that the length of a bout of REM is directly 
<br>
proportional to the preceding bout of non-REM. The longer you spend in 
<br>
non-REM, the more REM you need to &quot;recover&quot;, perhaps.
<br>
<p>In this view of sleep, REM is demoted to a secondary role as a recovery 
<br>
phase after whatever hard work is done during non-REM. &quot;Our premise is 
<br>
that something happens during non-REM - some imbalance builds up - that 
<br>
has to be corrected for in REM,&quot; says Heller.
<br>
<p>But what goes on in non-REM that means you need to recover afterwards? 
<br>
According to Heller, it's all to do with energy replenishment. During 
<br>
non-REM sleep your brain tops up its turbochargers - glycogen stores in 
<br>
the brain's supporting glial cells that neurons draw on when they 
<br>
absolutely have to work at maximum capacity. When they run down, they 
<br>
must be replenished.
<br>
<p>To do this, the brain would have to enter a quiescent state. To achieve 
<br>
this, suggests Heller, it might throw its neuronal membranes into a 
<br>
suppressed electrical state called &quot;hyperpolarisation&quot;, making them 
<br>
inactive and unresponsive to outside stimuli. This would manifest itself 
<br>
as the unconsciousness of slow wave sleep. Hyperpolarisation, however, 
<br>
comes at a price. It can only be achieved by allowing precious potassium 
<br>
ions to leak out of neurons. Such a state could only be maintained for 
<br>
so long without risking permanent loss of ions. Every now and again the 
<br>
brain has to pump potassium ions back in, repolarising the membrane and 
<br>
switching the cortex back on again, all the while keeping you in a 
<br>
relatively quiescent state. This is what we experience as REM sleep. All 
<br>
the exciting and spectacular facets of REM sleep are merely a by-product 
<br>
of the brain's housekeeping, no more and no less, says Heller. &quot;Dreaming 
<br>
and so on are really a second or third order phenomenon and are not a 
<br>
function of REM sleep at all.&quot;
<br>
<p>But isn't this rather disappointing? Can all the wonderful complexities 
<br>
and experiences we have in REM sleep really come down to brain cells 
<br>
hauling potassium ions across their membranes? Heller chuckles and 
<br>
points out the hypothesis remains largely untested; there is plenty of 
<br>
room for surprises. &quot;I'm sure it's going to turn out to be more complex 
<br>
than that.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, other ideas are emerging that put non-REM in the spotlight 
<br>
without relegating REM sleep completely to the level of the mundane. One 
<br>
hypothesis has been developed by Terrence Sejnowski of the computational 
<br>
neurobiology laboratory at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. 
<br>
In his hypothesis, non-REM sleep is also used for recovery and 
<br>
restoration, carrying out &quot;construction projects&quot; related to the rigours 
<br>
and events of its waking activity - replenishing proteins, strengthening 
<br>
synapses, inserting receptors into membranes and so on. You need to be 
<br>
unconscious during this activity so that there is no neuronal activity 
<br>
to get in the way - a bit like moving out of your house while the 
<br>
builders are in. Then, once the brain has completed some construction 
<br>
work, it flips into REM for an interim report. In effect the brain boots 
<br>
up some of its waking systems in a contained environment to test what it 
<br>
has done and find out what still needs to be completed. Then it slips 
<br>
back into non-REM sleep and gets on with the construction work.
<br>
<p>&quot;As you have experiences during the day, you're making a lot of small, 
<br>
temporary changes here and there,&quot; says Sejnowski. &quot;You need to organise 
<br>
and prioritise this information, and you do it in slow wave sleep.&quot; The 
<br>
evidence he has for this assertion comes from computer models of a 
<br>
phenomenon called &quot;spindling&quot; - spikes of electrical activity seen only 
<br>
during the transition from wakefulness to non-REM, and from REM back 
<br>
into non-REM. During spindling there is massive influx of calcium into 
<br>
neurons that have been modified by that day's experience. And calcium is 
<br>
known to be a crucial activator of enzyme function and gene expression - 
<br>
the kinds of biochemical heavy-lifting the brain would have to perform 
<br>
to convert these small changes into permanent ones.
<br>
<p>&quot;But you don't want to make all your changes at once,&quot; Sejnowski says. 
<br>
&quot;You make a few of them, and you test to see what impact this has. Maybe 
<br>
REM sleep is the test period.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is other evidence building for the idea that a brain's workload 
<br>
determines how much deep sleep a brain needs, perhaps even with 
<br>
harder-working areas showing different sleep states to those that had a 
<br>
more leisurely day (see &quot;Sleep or sleeps?&quot;).
<br>
<p>One of the beauties of these &quot;non-REM rules&quot; ideas is that they help 
<br>
explain why the brain cycles through several non-REM to REM bouts during 
<br>
a night's sleep, and why you always start the night with a bout of 
<br>
non-REM. If the two different modes of sleep have independent functions, 
<br>
then it's not clear why they should be organised in this way. But if 
<br>
non-REM sleep makes REM essential, then the way sleep is organised 
<br>
suddenly makes much more sense.
<br>
<p>Another leading researcher who sees REM as having a secondary but 
<br>
non-trivial function is Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the newly opened 
<br>
Sleep Research Centre at the University of Surrey in Guildford. He's 
<br>
sure that the main function of sleep is restorative and that the 
<br>
restoration process - whatever it is - has little to do with REM sleep. 
<br>
He points out that bouts of REM increase in length throughout the night 
<br>
and hit a peak at the very end of the sleep. &quot;This tells you something 
<br>
about the function of REM sleep,&quot; he says. &quot;It may not be that important 
<br>
to the recovery process.&quot;
<br>
<p>So what is it for? &quot;It may be more important for the transition from 
<br>
sleep and wakefulness. Some people have said that REM sleep is a gate to 
<br>
wakefulness.&quot; Animals very frequently wake up at the end of each REM 
<br>
episode, check all is well, then drift off again. Even humans may do it 
<br>
when there is something, say an infant, in need of regular checking.
<br>
<p>Another new theory pushes the importance of REM sleep even further down 
<br>
the list, at least in adults. According to this idea, REM does have a 
<br>
function - but only in the womb and soon after birth. REM sleep 
<br>
continues in adults only as a developmental relic of this function. It's 
<br>
the brain's belly button.
<br>
<p>The idea originated from a group led by Stephen Duntley of the Sleep 
<br>
Medicine Centre at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. They 
<br>
started from the well-known fact that as the brain develops, it prunes 
<br>
out redundant neurons in the cortex to build a sleek and honed thinking 
<br>
machine. The pruning tool is programmed cell death, or apoptosis, and 
<br>
the signal for it to occur is neuronal inactivity. Duntley's group 
<br>
believes the brain needs quiet periods of recovery and restoration, but 
<br>
this creates a problem in babies. You don't want to lose too many 
<br>
neurons as they descend into their quiescent sleeping state.
<br>
<p>The group also noted another well-known fact - that infants have a very 
<br>
high proportion of REM sleep, starting in the womb and continuing 
<br>
throughout early childhood. During REM sleep, neurons are very, very 
<br>
active indeed. From an EEG trace alone you would have a hard time 
<br>
distinguishing between REM and wakefulness. Could the two phenomena be 
<br>
related? Is frantic brain activity in REM anything to do with building a 
<br>
brain?
<br>
<p>To find out, group member Michael Morrissey used a drug called clonidine 
<br>
to selectively deprive very young rats of 60 per cent of their normal 
<br>
REM sleep. When they examined the rats' brains for markers of cell 
<br>
death, the results were clear: REM-deprived baby rats had huge amounts 
<br>
of apoptosis, much more than you would see in a healthy brain or in an 
<br>
adult given the same drug. &quot;It's way beyond normal,&quot; says Morrissey.
<br>
<p>The team speculates that REM sleep evolved to keep useful neurons busy 
<br>
and so save them from apoptosis, without forcing the animal to waste 
<br>
precious energy on staying awake. &quot;It's a very exciting theory,&quot; says 
<br>
Duntley.
<br>
<p>Critics agree that it's an interesting idea, but are not yet convinced 
<br>
by the data. David Gozal, an expert in childhood sleep at the University 
<br>
of Louisville in Kentucky, points out that the apoptosis assay the team 
<br>
used is not very sensitive. Given that there is so much apoptosis going 
<br>
on at this stage of development, it's hard to say for sure that there's 
<br>
an abnormal load in REM-deprived rats. Duntley counters by saying that 
<br>
the work is at a very early stage and the hypothesis should be easily 
<br>
testable with refined techniques. Watch this space.
<br>
<p>But there is another prominent group of theorists who refuse to accept 
<br>
that sleep is merely a time for rest and recuperation. They prefer to 
<br>
assign sleep - particularly REM - a more fittingly cerebral role in 
<br>
information processing, categorising and storing memories, perhaps, or 
<br>
even thinking creatively.
<br>
<p>The idea that sleep plays a crucial role in learning and memory goes 
<br>
back to 1983 at least, when James Watson of double-helix fame, proposed 
<br>
that REM was responsible for the destruction of unwanted facts and 
<br>
experiences. Since then the field has exploded, producing reams of 
<br>
evidence that REM sleep is intimately involved with what's known as 
<br>
&quot;procedural memory&quot; - learning how to perform a complex task such as 
<br>
riding a bike or playing the piano. (The other sort of memory, 
<br>
&quot;declarative memory&quot; for storing facts and figures, seems to be 
<br>
unaffected by sleep.)
<br>
<p>In one classic experiment, volunteers were asked to spend four hours 
<br>
playing an apparently simple video game involving six targets with 
<br>
buttons underneath. The rules are very straightforward: when a target 
<br>
lights up, subjects press the corresponding button. The researchers 
<br>
measure their reaction times to see how good they are at the game. The 
<br>
more subjects play, they better they get. What the players don't know, 
<br>
however, is that the targets don't light up at random. There is a 
<br>
complex imperceptible set of rules determining the sequence with which 
<br>
they light up.
<br>
<p>Then comes the interesting bit. The volunteers are allowed a good 
<br>
night's sleep and then retested. Miraculously, their performance 
<br>
improves a great deal overnight. But not in every case. In some 
<br>
volunteers there is no improvement at all. The difference? One set of 
<br>
non-improvers was deprived of REM sleep by repeatedly being wakened 
<br>
through the night. The other was playing a game in which the sequence 
<br>
was totally random. There's nothing to learn, and so no overnight 
<br>
improvement. The conclusion? Spending time in REM asleep helps 
<br>
&quot;consolidate&quot; procedural memory.
<br>
<p>Many similar experiments have come to the same conclusions about the 
<br>
role of REM sleep in procedural memory. And there is supporting evidence 
<br>
from other types of experiment, too. For example, PET imaging of the 
<br>
brain as it learns a procedural task shows a characteristic pattern of 
<br>
activity which is repeated again and again during REM sleep. This 
<br>
activity is taken to be memory consolidation in action.
<br>
<p>But once again, it is a measure of non-REM's growing influence and of 
<br>
REM's waning one that researchers have begun to grant it a central role 
<br>
in information processing too (New Scientist, 25 September 1999, p 26). 
<br>
This is quite a reversal. &quot;REM sleep was seen as the most important, but 
<br>
now slow wave sleep is moving up fast,&quot; says Carlyle Smith, the director 
<br>
of Trent University's sleep labs in Peterborough, Ontario, and a leading 
<br>
proponent of sleep's role in memory consolidation.
<br>
<p>In particular it seems that slow wave sleep is when the brain processes 
<br>
spatial memories - learning your way around a new city, for example. In 
<br>
one experiment, volunteers had to learn to navigate their way around a 
<br>
virtual city using a joystick while their brains were being imaged with 
<br>
PET. As they learned the routes, the PET scan showed intensive activity 
<br>
in the hippocampus, as expected from previous work showing its vital 
<br>
role in spatial learning.
<br>
<p>The subjects then slept while hooked up to the PET machine. During slow 
<br>
wave sleep their hippocampuses showed exactly the same patterns of brain 
<br>
activity as during learning, and the next morning they were much better 
<br>
at finding their way around. &quot;Slow wave sleep really has something to do 
<br>
with memory,&quot; concludes Philippe Peigneux of the University of Liège in 
<br>
Belgium, who carried out the tests.
<br>
<p>The idea that you learn in your sleep has obvious appeal and has lodged 
<br>
in the popular consciousness. But not everyone thinks it is correct. 
<br>
There is a small and highly vocal group of critics who say that sleep 
<br>
has absolutely nothing to do with memory. It looks as though even this 
<br>
most compelling of sleep function theories will have to stay on the 
<br>
&quot;unproven&quot; pile until more evidence comes in.
<br>
<p>One of the most strident critics is Robert Vertes of the Center for 
<br>
Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University, Boca 
<br>
Raton. He claims that the evidence for a role for REM sleep in memory is 
<br>
highly contradictory, with about half the published studies showing 
<br>
sleep has no effect. And in those that show a positive effect you cannot 
<br>
control for the stressful effects of REM sleep deprivation. Perhaps 
<br>
sleep-deprived subjects perform worse simply because they are tired.
<br>
<p>Vertes's most compelling evidence, however, comes from patients with 
<br>
brain injuries who do not get any REM sleep at all. In one remarkable 
<br>
case, a man was hit by shrapnel from a bullet at the age of 20 which 
<br>
deprived him almost completely of the ability to enter REM sleep. At 
<br>
best he was getting 1 to 2 per cent REM sleep at night. Yet he continued 
<br>
his education and became a practising lawyer. It's hard to imagine 
<br>
someone severely deficient in procedural memory achieving this, Vertes says.
<br>
<p>Another line of counter-evidence comes from animals. &quot;If you think about 
<br>
the theories of REM sleep serving some intellectual function, the fact 
<br>
that most mammals have about the same percentage of REM sleep gives you 
<br>
pause for thought,&quot; says Heller. &quot;Does a cow really have as many 
<br>
problems as we do?&quot; A similar point is made by Jerome Siegal of the 
<br>
University of California, Los Angeles. He points out that there seems to 
<br>
be no correlation between mental capacity and REM sleep duration (see 
<br>
Diagram). Platypuses, for example, sleep for about 14 hours a day, of 
<br>
which 8 hours are REM sleep. &quot;The platypus is a lovely animal, but it's 
<br>
also a rather stupid animal,&quot; says Siegal.
<br>
<p>The theory's proponents won't have any of it. Robert Stickgold of 
<br>
Harvard Medical School, for example, says that evidence in favour of 
<br>
information processing is so good that it cannot be disputed. The best 
<br>
studies control for tiredness and have confidence limits of 0.001, he 
<br>
says. And the animal comparisons are meaningless and unscientific - 
<br>
rather like saying that because millipedes have dozens of legs yet move 
<br>
more slowly than cheetahs, legs cannot be for locomotion.
<br>
<p>So, half a century on from the start of modern sleep science, are we any 
<br>
closer to understanding what sleep is for? Things have at least moved on 
<br>
from the days when sleep was simply a form of inactivity and dreams were 
<br>
for prying into your private desires, and might well have come from the 
<br>
kidneys, for all the biology that was known. And there are plenty of new 
<br>
techniques coming into their own that might help settle some of the 
<br>
arguments. The ability to make tissue slices &quot;sleep&quot; in a dish, better 
<br>
and better brain scanners, new mass genetic screening techniques, mutant 
<br>
flies with sleep deficits, and connections with the fields of circadian 
<br>
rhythms and metabolic control - any one of these new developments could 
<br>
be the key to the puzzle. The one thing everyone agrees on is that it is 
<br>
a goal worth pursuing. &quot;If we did know what the function of sleep was, 
<br>
things would change dramatically,&quot; says Heller.

<br>
What dreams are made of
<br>
<p>Move over Freud. Modern sleep researchers are starting to analyse dream 
<br>
content, and it has nothing to do with your mother
<br>
<p>THE 1953 discovery of REM sleep and its clear link with dreaming 
<br>
(Science, vol 118, p 273) gave a huge boost to dream researchers. Until 
<br>
this point, the study of dreams was almost the exclusive domain of the 
<br>
Freudians, who believed the content of our dreams was a hotline to our 
<br>
innermost desires and feelings. But the obvious mental and physical 
<br>
signatures of REM sleep - rapid eye movements, frantic brain activity, 
<br>
and (to the delight of the Freudians) penile erections - opened the door 
<br>
to studying dreams as a real biological phenomenon. &quot;We rejoiced in the 
<br>
discovery of REM sleep,&quot; recalls J. Allan Hobson, a veteran psychiatrist 
<br>
and dream researcher at Harvard Medical School. &quot;We thought it would 
<br>
make psychoanalysis scientific.&quot;
<br>
<p>It wasn't as easy as they hoped. Researchers failed to find any 
<br>
consistent links between physical and mental activity and dream content. 
<br>
Eye movements, for example, rarely tracked the visual content of dreams. 
<br>
Erections had little to do with dreams' erotic content. Worst of all, 
<br>
within a decade, the apparently clear-cut connection between REM sleep 
<br>
and dreaming melted away, as researchers noted almost as many dream 
<br>
reports when people were woken from non-REM sleep as from REM. If 
<br>
dreaming could come from two such disparate brain states, how would we 
<br>
ever explain it?
<br>
<p>In the past few years, however, the biological study of dreaming has 
<br>
undergone something of a revival. Cognitive neuroscientists and 
<br>
neurologists are getting in on the act, using new tools to work out what 
<br>
causes the experience of dreaming and even what its function might be.
<br>
<p>One of the key discoveries is that dreams reported after waking from 
<br>
non-REM sleep may originate in REM sleep after all. Using sensitive 
<br>
electrical monitoring techniques to eavesdrop on the activity of the 
<br>
sleeping brain, Tore Nielsen of the University of Montreal and others 
<br>
have spotted brief fragments of REM, so called &quot;covert REM&quot;, intruding 
<br>
into non-REM sleep. These were just too subtle to be picked up by 
<br>
standard equipment. Another recent study led by Hiroyuki Suzuki of 
<br>
Japan's National Institute of Mental Health in Ichikawa has confirmed 
<br>
that, despite prodigious dream reports from non-REM awakenings, there is 
<br>
a huge qualitative difference between the two kinds of dreaming. Non-REM 
<br>
dreams tend to be short and dull. REM dreams, in contrast, are vivid and 
<br>
long.
<br>
<p>The re-corralling of the richest dreams back into REM sleep, when brain 
<br>
activity is at its liveliest, has encouraged other researchers to take a 
<br>
fresh look at dreams to see what they tell us about cognition during 
<br>
sleep. &quot;Dreams are the only source of cognitive information we've got,&quot; 
<br>
says Sophie Schwartz, from the University of Geneva in Switzerland.
<br>
<p>One big question is whether the brain activity you see in REM sleep 
<br>
corresponds with the experiences we call dreams. To find out, a team 
<br>
lead by Pierre Maquet at the University of Liège in Belgium made a 
<br>
&quot;sleep map&quot; of the brain, using the imaging technique PET to find out 
<br>
which areas were busiest during the different phases of sleep. Their 
<br>
results showed that brain activity in REM is very different from non-REM 
<br>
or wakefulness - and that it tallies nicely with the content of dreams.
<br>
<p>During dreams, visual areas are very active, as are the amygdala, 
<br>
thalamus and the brainstem, which fits with the fact that dreams tend to 
<br>
be very visual and emotional. At the same time, the prefrontal and 
<br>
parietal cortices and the posterior cingulate, areas which deal with 
<br>
rational thought and attention, are all very quiet, which tallies with 
<br>
the lack of insight, illogicality and time distortion that characterises 
<br>
dreams (see Diagram).
<br>
<p>Maquet accepts that this conclusion is too general to give any major 
<br>
insights into the process of dreaming. But there is another promising 
<br>
approach on the horizon. Schwartz, who was once part of Maquet's group, 
<br>
suggests we can learn from patients with neurological damage for whom 
<br>
everyday experience is full of bizarre events most of us only experience 
<br>
while dreaming.
<br>
<p>Schwartz is currently focusing on Frégoli syndrome, in which people 
<br>
constantly mistake strangers for people they know, even though there are 
<br>
no physical similarities. It's a mistake that happens all the time in 
<br>
dreams. Frégoli syndrome is caused by brain damage which severs the link 
<br>
between the prefrontal cortex and the other brain structures involved in 
<br>
recognising faces. The way she sees it is this: if you monitor these 
<br>
areas in normal sleeping subjects, you can ask whether Frégoli-type 
<br>
dreams coincide with Frégoli-type brain activity.
<br>
<p>There are numerous other brain lesions that cause dreamlike perception 
<br>
during waking - reduplicative paramnesia, in which patients recognise 
<br>
new places as familiar, micropsia and macropsia, where you see things as 
<br>
too big or too small, palinopsia, where you see multiple copies of an 
<br>
object, and achromatopsia, in which colour perception goes haywire. 
<br>
Schwartz says that all of these could help us make links between brain 
<br>
activity and standard dream events.
<br>
<p>But none of this answers the most critical and intriguing question: what 
<br>
are dreams for?
<br>
<p>Are we any closer to an answer?
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think we know anything with any confidence about what dreams 
<br>
are for,&quot; says psychiatrist Robert Stickgold of Harvard Medical School. 
<br>
But he has some ideas. Stickgold believes that one of the critical 
<br>
functions of dreaming is information processing, including memory 
<br>
consolidation (see main story). But he's recently extended the idea into 
<br>
a wider concept of information processing he calls &quot;finding meaning&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sometimes when you have a difficult decision to make, all the rational 
<br>
thinking in the world won't give you the answer, he points out. So what 
<br>
do you do? &quot;You go home that night and you sleep on it,&quot; says Stickgold. 
<br>
By the morning you somehow have the answer even though you've gained no 
<br>
new information overnight.
<br>
<p>It is dreaming during REM sleep, he thinks, that performs this magical 
<br>
decision-making process. As you dream, your brain runs through imaginary 
<br>
scenarios, testing your emotional response to them without rationality 
<br>
getting in the way. He now has experimental evidence that REM sleep 
<br>
promotes creative thought, allowing you to bring together widely 
<br>
differing concepts you would never link while awake.
<br>
<p>The evidence comes from a common cognitive test of a process called 
<br>
priming. Normally the investigator would show someone a word, then 
<br>
quickly flash up another, either real or meaningless. The task is to 
<br>
work out whether it's a real word or not. If the second word is related 
<br>
to the first, say the pair were &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, then the decision 
<br>
time is usually significantly faster than, say, &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;paper&quot;. The 
<br>
reason, according to conventional theory, is that the first word has 
<br>
primed the brain to recognise related words by activating networks of 
<br>
associated concepts.
<br>
<p>Stickgold, though, was not interested in wakeful consciousness. He 
<br>
tested people who had just been roused from REM sleep. The result was 
<br>
the exact opposite of wakefulness. The more distantly related the second 
<br>
word, the faster the subjects recognised it. &quot;In REM sleep, the brain 
<br>
ignores the obvious in favour of the crazy, the unexpected or the 
<br>
bizarre,&quot; Stickgold says. &quot;It's biased towards activating weak, 
<br>
non-obvious and potentially useful connections.&quot; And this, he says, is 
<br>
what allows us to make meaning out of complex information. It might even 
<br>
be the origin of creativity.
<br>
-----------------------------------
<br>
Sleep or sleeps?
<br>
<p>Do different parts of your brain sleep in different ways? Ever since the 
<br>
discovery of REM we have known that there are several distinct states of 
<br>
sleep. Now it looks as though different patches of the brain can be in 
<br>
different sleep states at the same time. &quot;Sleep is not a whole-brain 
<br>
phenomenon,&quot; says James Krueger at Washington State University in 
<br>
Pullman. &quot;It's a localised property.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dolphins and some birds and fish are already known to sleep with one 
<br>
cerebral hemisphere at a time, either to stay alert or so they don't 
<br>
drown. But Krueger's idea runs deeper, suggesting that sleep is a 
<br>
completely devolved system, with different brain regions making their 
<br>
own decisions about depth and onset of sleep. His concept of sleep is at 
<br>
an early stage, and he has just started revealing his evidence to other 
<br>
researchers. But if he is right, then it could give us some new hints 
<br>
about what sleep is for.
<br>
<p>The first sign that sleep states might differ between brain regions came 
<br>
from studies of &quot;sleep regulatory substances&quot;, biochemicals that build 
<br>
up in the brain during wakefulness and apparently help trigger the 
<br>
transition into sleep. Around 10 years ago Krueger noticed that these 
<br>
substances build up faster in parts of the brain that are most active 
<br>
during wakefulness. Did this have any effect on subsequent sleep?
<br>
<p>It turns out that it does. Apply extra amounts of sleep substances to 
<br>
one hemisphere of the cortex and not the other and the result is much 
<br>
deeper non-REM sleep on that side, as well as subtle differences in REM 
<br>
activity. It seems as if the harder a brain region works during the day, 
<br>
the harder it has to sleep at night.
<br>
<p>This tallies with other findings. Cats and rats that are kept in the 
<br>
dark during wakeful hours have unusually shallow non-REM sleep in the 
<br>
visual cortex, but much deeper non-REM sleep in the part of the cortex 
<br>
dealing with touch. And if you trim a rat's whiskers on one side then 
<br>
put it into a maze, the corresponding half of its brain sleeps more 
<br>
deeply later on - presumably because it had to work harder processing 
<br>
incoming data.
<br>
<p>And according to David Rector of Washington State University, you can 
<br>
even see devolved sleep in an EEG trace. He says that a close reading of 
<br>
EEGs reveals that what looks like a steady state is anything but. Though 
<br>
the overall effect might look uniform, on a more local level brain 
<br>
activity is highly changeable, with different neuronal groups constantly 
<br>
cycling between states. What's more, Krueger points out that in people 
<br>
who survive brain injury, regardless of which parts of the brain are 
<br>
lost the patient always remains capable of sleep. This suggests that 
<br>
sleep is an intrinsic property of brain cells and doesn't need to be 
<br>
imposed from the top.
<br>
<p>Support for this view is also coming from experiments on groups of 
<br>
neurons grown in a Petri dish, which spontaneously produce states very 
<br>
like non-REM sleep. Deprive these neurons of their shut-eye and they go 
<br>
haywire, firing rapidly and randomly in an epileptic-like state. Sleep, 
<br>
then, seems to be an inherent property of small neural networks which 
<br>
keeps them in good shape. Is this how sleep evolved and why we have to 
<br>
do it?
<br>
<p>Perhaps the most intriguing spin-off from this work is to understand the 
<br>
mysterious &quot;state dissociation&quot; disorders - cataplexy, for example, 
<br>
where the loss of muscle tone designed to stop you from acting out 
<br>
dreams unexpectedly switches on during wakefulness and makes you fall 
<br>
over, or dream enactment where muscle tone remains switched on in REM 
<br>
sleep. Doctors have long assumed these are caused by some unspecified 
<br>
mixing of states of consciousness. Krueger's theory might just prove 
<br>
them right.
