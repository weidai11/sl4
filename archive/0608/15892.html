Jeff,
<br>
<p>I am glad that you are focussing on the issues, but I have only enough 
<br>
energy to try to deal with one, highly focussed point in your argument 
<br>
below.
<br>
<p>I am going to be extremely careful, and by being that careful I am going 
<br>
to show that you are making the most incredible mistake in what you say 
<br>
below.  I am going to be careful enough that you can actually go and 
<br>
make a simple check and verify what I say for yourself, with an outside, 
<br>
independent source.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Which of the following is more probable:

<em>&gt;    1) Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    2) Linda is a bank teller and NOT active in the feminist movement.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a pretty straightforward claim.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has been disconfirmed in the h&amp;b lit.
</em><br>
<p>Let's concentrate on this, in the hope that some progress can be made by 
<br>
being very, very precise on at least one point.
<br>
<p>What exactly was disconfirmed in the h&amp;b literature here?  There was a 
<br>
WEAK claim, implicit in a lot of the attacks made against experiments 
<br>
like the first Linda ones, and that weak claim could be paraphrased as 
<br>
follows:
<br>
<p>Weak Claim:  The Linda results can be explained away (i.e. they would 
<br>
vanish completely) if subjects were not misled or confused by the nature 
<br>
of the question.  In other words, the weak claim is that the Linda 
<br>
result is purely a consequence of asking the question in such a way that 
<br>
the subject was tricked into a misunderstanding.
<br>
<p>Are you with me so far?  This claim is an attempt to say that, in 
<br>
effect, the experimental result was an artifact of a bad design.  A 
<br>
better design would ask the question in such a way that the subjects 
<br>
were not misled, and then (the weak claim would say), we would expect 
<br>
the effect to disappear.
<br>
<p>To people familiar with the way that this subfield played itself out, 
<br>
this is the Familiar Story:  first the Linda experiments, then the 
<br>
attempts to claim they were flawed, then the subsequent experiments 
<br>
which .... well, we won't jump the gun just yet, but to someone like 
<br>
myself or another cognitive scientist familiar with the literature, the 
<br>
story DID involve this Weak Claim, and then the subsequent attempts to 
<br>
see if it was an adequate counter to the original interpretation of the 
<br>
experimental results.
<br>
<p>To someone who was in a hurry, reading those paragraphs of mine that you 
<br>
quoted above  -  and *not* bothering to read further into the message  - 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;might give them the impression that all I was doing was writing out a 
<br>
simpleminded restatement of that Weak Claim.
<br>
<p>So, now:  what happened to that Weak Claim.  Well, guess what?  It was 
<br>
disproved, as Eliezer put it, every whcih way from Sunday.  The simple 
<br>
version of the story is that they re-did the first Linda experiments, 
<br>
and then re-did them again as OTHER alternative explanations of the 
<br>
results were offered, until eventually it was shown that the effect was 
<br>
real:  people were not simply misunderstanding an ambiguous question, 
<br>
they were doing something wrong inside their heads.  The Weak Claim was 
<br>
not supported, at the end of the day.
<br>
<p>But now I want to point something out to you.  In my message I make a 
<br>
very precise statement:  I say that the &quot;the [Linda] question would 
<br>
quite likely be interpreted as...&quot; and I give the alternative that was 
<br>
first proposed as a misreading of the experimental question.
<br>
<p>This is the crucial point:  you (and Eliezer before you) jump on this 
<br>
statement and *immediately* say:
<br>
<p><em> &gt; This is a pretty straightforward claim.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;
</em><br>
<em> &gt; It has been disconfirmed in the h&amp;b lit.
</em><br>
<p>Jeff:  do you *know* that the effect was much weaker when the confusion 
<br>
was eliminated?  Do you *know* that when the protocol was tightened up 
<br>
to exclude that alternative explanation, the effect diminished?
<br>
<p>Do you understand what that means?  It means that the alternative 
<br>
explanation quite likely *did* play a role in the initially observed effect.
<br>
<p>And the subsequent history of the series of experiments was that when 
<br>
other alternatives were suggested by those advocating the Weak Claim, 
<br>
many of those, too, when they were eliminated as possibilities, caused 
<br>
the effect to go down.  Not all of them, but many of them.
<br>
<p>And so this means that, whatever was happening, the alternative 
<br>
explanations offered DID turn out to be something that was going on in 
<br>
the minds of the subjects.
<br>
<p>This is important, because I *knew* this perfectly well when I wrote 
<br>
what I wrote:  I knew it because I am a cognitive scientist steeped in 
<br>
the experimental and theoretical results of this field, and I have known 
<br>
it for a long time.  When I wrote my words in that first message, I was 
<br>
generous enough to give Eliezer credit for also knowing the field, and 
<br>
so I did not hand-hold him through all the tedious details, assuming 
<br>
that he was smart enough to know them already.
<br>
<p>What is the significance of this?  Quite simple:  my words &quot;the [Linda] 
<br>
question would quite likely be interpreted as...&quot; introduced one of the 
<br>
mechanisms that DID kick into play ....  this was my introduction of an 
<br>
example mechanism that is at least partially responsible for what goes 
<br>
on in the head of the subject when confronted by the Linda question.
<br>
<p>Did I say (as the people who advocated the weak claim tried to do) that 
<br>
this alternative could EXPLAIN AWAY ALL OF THE RESULT?  I most certainly 
<br>
did not:  that is the Weak Claim itself, and I took it for granted that 
<br>
nobody except an outsider who did not know the field would attempt to 
<br>
defend it.  I wouldn't have dreamed of trying to do that.  I'm no dummy.
<br>
<p>So what that means is, that when you, in your words above, quote my 
<br>
statement and then say &quot;This is a pretty straightforward claim.&quot;  and 
<br>
then &quot;It has been disconfirmed in the h&amp;b lit.&quot; you are guilty of not 
<br>
looking at the precise words that I used, and perhaps guilty of not 
<br>
knowing the literature:  when I said that subjects would quite likely 
<br>
have made that mistake, I was making a precisely correct claim:  the 
<br>
literature *did* support that claim.
<br>
<p>By saying that my words were a &quot;pretty straighforward claim&quot; you are 
<br>
saying, in effect, that YOU interpreted this to be an obvious statement 
<br>
of the Weak Claim.  It was not obviously such a thing, but unless you 
<br>
knew the literature pretty well, you might not have realized that fact.
<br>
<p>But even if you had not been familar with the literature, you are also 
<br>
guilty of taking that statement of mine and cutting it off from its 
<br>
context:  by chopping it away from the rest of the post, and pretending 
<br>
that it should be considered on its own, you distorted its meaning in 
<br>
every bit as heinous a way as the tabloid journalist who selectively 
<br>
edits a quote to turn the meaning on its head.
<br>
<p>Because after I introduce that statement I go on to make it clear that 
<br>
my interest is not in the Weak Claim at all, and that the whole focus of 
<br>
my essay was on the mechanisms which are *known* to be involved.  And 
<br>
just in case anybody might have doubted it, I stated very clearly that I 
<br>
disavowed the Weak Claim.
<br>
<p>So even if someone (an expert, say) were reading my essay and came 
<br>
across that first statement of mine, and  -  because they were not 
<br>
paying careful attention  -  thought that I was making the discredited 
<br>
Weak Claim, that person need only read a little further and see that a 
<br>
sentence or two later I reject the Weak Claim explicitly, at which point 
<br>
a smart person would realize their mistake and look carefully at what I 
<br>
said..... at which point they would discover that I was making a far 
<br>
more sophisticated claim than any of those old ones that were in the 
<br>
early literature.
<br>
<p>So when you say below that this was my first claim, I say:  look at the 
<br>
words and you will see that even if you cut the text in half at that 
<br>
point, my words were carefully chosen and were not equivalent to the 
<br>
weak claim at all ... and if you had been knowledgeable of the field you 
<br>
would certainly have held your horses at that point and said to yourself 
<br>
&quot;Well... he is right to say that the subjects could well have 
<br>
interpreted the question in that way, because the results showed that 
<br>
the first batch of subjects were indeed doing this at least part of the 
<br>
time...&quot; and you would have continued reading to find out where I was 
<br>
going to take it.
<br>
<p>In your own case, Jeff, I guess my only criticism would be that you have 
<br>
jumped into this argument not knowing the field in enough detail (and 
<br>
you have never claimed to know the field, I should add) ... so my only 
<br>
complaint is that you are not in any position to make the statements 
<br>
that you make (above and below) about which one of my paragraphs 
<br>
constitutes a separate claim.   In my opinion you have embarrassed 
<br>
yourself by stepping into the fray and judging the argument by looking 
<br>
at the words alone, without knowing the background facts to which those 
<br>
words were referring, and by being careless about interpreting those 
<br>
words (again, due to lack of knowledge).
<br>
<p>You have an excuse.  Eliezer does not.  He claims to be an expert.  His 
<br>
supposed knowledge *should* have led him to interpret my words correctly 
<br>
(saying to himself:  &quot;True enough, later research did show that the 
<br>
subjects sometimes did this in the first experiment:  now what of it?&quot;).
<br>
<p>Reading onward in my post he would have seen my claim laid out carefully 
<br>
and precisely.  With the (supposed) knowledge at his command he should 
<br>
have understood the detailed character of my argument, and quickly 
<br>
realised that I could not possibly be talking about anything as foolish 
<br>
as the Weak Claim.
<br>
<p>(At that point, I still gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed 
<br>
that he *did* understand the field, but had just boxed himself into a 
<br>
corner from which he was too embarrassed to extricate himself.)
<br>
<p>He may well have had questions at that point.  I am not perfect:  I do 
<br>
my best, but still I may not get my point across perfectly the first 
<br>
time.  So ask questions!
<br>
<p>[This is what you are implictly starting to do in your words below 
<br>
(mixed with restatements of the false claim that I have just analyzed). 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair enough:  but this is the discussion that should have taken place, 
<br>
back at the beginning.  I am not going to have it now, with you, for 
<br>
obvious reasons.]
<br>
<p>Instead, I was treated, back in his first response, to a pathetically 
<br>
weak and supercilious piece of garbage, recommending that I do some 
<br>
reading that I actually did nineteen years ago.  And that was just his 
<br>
*first* response:  after that one I wrote a carefully constructed reply 
<br>
to explain what the situation was, in the most thoughtful detail.  It 
<br>
took a lot of effort to write that explanation:  he didn't deserve it, 
<br>
but I did it anyway.
<br>
<p>When he finally replied to that essay, the other day, I found myself on 
<br>
the receiving end of the most amateurish display of petulance, stupidity 
<br>
and arrogance that I have ever seen in someone who claimed to be a 
<br>
scientist, which then blossomed into fantasy allegations that showed 
<br>
rather conclusively that I had been wrong in giving him the benefit of 
<br>
the doubt.  He clearly knows the h&amp;b subfield of the human reasoning 
<br>
studies, but he knows nothing outside that area.
<br>
<p>So I end with your attempt to put a charitable reading on the situation 
<br>
when you talk about Eliezer's misunderstanding of Johnson-Laird, below. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry Jeff: it would be nice if things were as you say, but you 
<br>
could only make your statement if you simply did not know the cognitive 
<br>
psychology field.  Johnson-Laird's book &quot;Mental Models&quot; is one of the 
<br>
classics of the human reasoning literature - it is his one claim to 
<br>
fame, not just some little bit of work among hundreds of other papers.
<br>
<p>Mental Models may not be on the same sub-branch as the h&amp;b stuff (and 
<br>
note:  I never said *anything* about it being here, there or anywhere!), 
<br>
but if you were to ask any cognitive psychologist who is familar with 
<br>
the stuff in the &quot;Human Reasoning&quot; chapters of elementary cog psy 
<br>
textbooks, whether it might be possible for an expert in that area to 
<br>
simply not know who Johnson-Laird is, or to not immediately know that 
<br>
the phrase &quot;mental models&quot; in the context of Johnson-Laird meant 
<br>
something very specific, they would laugh at you.  Try it if you don't 
<br>
believe me.  They'll probably think it is some kind of trick question.
<br>
<p>Sincerely,
<br>
<p>Richard Loosemore.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is what Eliezer commented on in his reply here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html">http://sl4.org/archive/0605/14749.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not your main claim.  That's great.  It doesn't matter, because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's what Eliezer actually commented on.  He, like everyone, gets to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pick which subclaims he wishes to focus on, right?  Right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; From your later comment in the above referenced post…
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;&gt; [Eliezer said:] In each of these experiments, human psychology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fails to follow the rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of probability theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [to which Richard replied:] Correct:  because in normal discourse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human psychology is required to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry out far more complex, broad-spectrum cognitive processing than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere calculation of probabilities.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; … it appears you thought Eliezer thinks the human brain does or should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely calculate probabilities, rather than function in the complex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialized, modular fashion that it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's pretty obvious that he doesn't, given how big on evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; psychology he is, and seeing as the EP folks heavily emphasize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specialization of different components in the brain for particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tasks in particular contexts.  If you'd ever taken a look at his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Levels of Organization in General Intelligence&quot; paper, you'd know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And we all already know you disagree with Eli's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-human-psychology-based, decision-theoretic approach to building a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking thing.  So, on that point (re how to build an AGI), you've
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shared nothing new, and one wonders why you spoke up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conjunction Fallacy thread at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paring away the ad hominem that came later, and the admittedly unusual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact that Eliezer had to look up Johnson-Laird (though there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between having to look him up because he didn't know who he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was or what he did generally, and having to look up his large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bibliography of work to verify whether or not J-L did any work on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; H&amp;B), you two have just been talking past one another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You, Richard, took Eli's reply to be a criticism of your main point,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when he hadn't responded to your main point at all.  Since Eli's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comment was so very clearly directed as applying to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;interpretation&quot; subclaim I quoted above (and which *he* quoted in his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reply, so as to be clear what he was replying to), your repeated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protestations that Eli wasn't addressing your claim fell (and continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fall) on deaf ears – he wasn't *trying* to reply to your main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim, so why are you complaining that he's doing something wrong or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfair?  You did a poor job of reading his email, viz. as if it, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself, were proffered as a wide-swath rejection of your overall claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how to build a (human-like) AGI, and responded in accordance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with that misreading, causing all this hullaballoo.
