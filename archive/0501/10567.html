<p>
Sorry to wade in here with such bluntness.  But I actually work in an 
<br>
engineering field that defines vague english words with rigorous 
<br>
technical definitions to describe emergent properties of systems not 
<br>
associated with any individual component design.  I really use these 
<br>
definitions to develop and implement technical security architectures.  
<br>
At some point, the words have to stop being vague english words and 
<br>
must be given rigorous technical definitions.  These definitions must 
<br>
be sound if the concepts are to be used to actually engineer some 
<br>
design.  I am afraid that this &quot;definition&quot; totally fails to work as a 
<br>
definition.
<br>
<p>In security, the field is full of nebulous english words that are like 
<br>
&quot;friendliness&quot;.  They describe attributes or aspects of a system that 
<br>
are not isolated to a single function or object within the 
<br>
architecture.  They are emergent properties that we want to result.  
<br>
&quot;Friendliness&quot; is no more difficult or technical or nebulous than what 
<br>
I work with every day.  Real engineering methods and techniques will 
<br>
work here as anywhere.  I see no reason to resort to imprecise 
<br>
definitions, claims of incomputability, or other excuses to explain why 
<br>
no clear definition can be achieved.
<br>
<p>Examples of similar types of hard-to-define terms in my field would 
<br>
include:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECURITY = CONFIDENTIALITY + INTEGRITY + AVAILABILITY, where:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONFIDENTIALITY = Access + Privacy, where:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Access = access controlability + identification + authentication + 
<br>
authorization + custody chain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy = consent + anonymity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;INTEGRITY = Accountability + Assurance + Capability + Safety, where:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accountability = authenticity + traceability + non-repudiation + 
<br>
recordkeeping
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assurance = legality + licensing + compliance + auditability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capability = relevance + suitability + correctness + accuracy + 
<br>
effectiveness + efficiency + cost
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety = equipment safety + environmental safety + interface safety
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AVAILABILITY = Usability + Reliability + Maintainability + 
<br>
Compatibility, where:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usability = interconnectivity + accessibility + performance + 
<br>
productivity + consistency + predictability + understandability + 
<br>
learnability + operability + localization + persistence
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reliability = continuity + maturity + fault tolerance + conciseness 
<br>
+ openness + survivability + recoverability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintainability = scalability + changeability + extensibility + 
<br>
analyzability + stability + testability + modularity + configurability 
<br>
+ customizability
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compatibility = interoperability + integration + portability + 
<br>
reusability + replaceability + adaptability + installability + 
<br>
conformance
<br>
<p>As you can see, all of these are plain english words that describe 
<br>
happy/fluffy ideas of &quot;good things&quot;. But they have all been given 
<br>
precise and rigorous definitions in the engineering fields.  They can 
<br>
be calculated with mathematical formulas and statistics.  They can be 
<br>
audited.  They can be bought and sold as measureable commodities.  My 
<br>
career is based on meeting these terms in ways that can be 
<br>
mathematically, legally, and realisitically be proven.  &quot;Friendliness&quot; 
<br>
must be similarly defined to a rigorous or precise level.  Otherwise, 
<br>
it can never be approached with real technology or engineering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Proposition: A mind is a utility function.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe itself could be interpreted as a kind of mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the limit that it formed a super-intelligence at an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega Point.  Therefore any concept within reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be interpreted as a 'utility function' within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universal mind.
</em><br>
<p>These are very controversial and non-obvious propositions on which to 
<br>
base your definitions.  Is friendliness really dependent on the 
<br>
universe being a &quot;mind&quot;?  If I dispute that the universe is a &quot;mind&quot;, 
<br>
does that mean friendliness doesn't exist?  Your evidence that all 
<br>
concepts in reality can be coded as utility functions within an AI is 
<br>
based on the fact that the universe is a mind which codes all reality 
<br>
at the omega point?  This is more of a religious faith-based assumption 
<br>
than a basis for an engineering design of an AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 'Omega Point' condition requires that the rate of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information processing (computation) within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe approaches infinity as time approaches the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end.  The idea is that a concept is no different to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the computational function existing in the mind of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligence which generates a list of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things possessing the attribute, in the limit that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Omega Point condition is approached.
</em><br>
<p>Besides requiring the universe to be a mind, your definitions seem to 
<br>
require a Tipler-type omega point to occur for your definition.  Since 
<br>
this is unknown and unproven at this point, it sounds like your 
<br>
definition must be unknown or unproven for now as well.  Since the 
<br>
Omega Point won't occur until the end of the universe, it is unclear 
<br>
that your explanation applies to anything today.  Can't you base your 
<br>
examples on physics existing now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Example:  The concept 'Beauty' is defined as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent to the mathematical function which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generates a list of all beautiful things.
</em><br>
<p>This is a circular definition.  You defined beauty by using the word 
<br>
&quot;beautiful&quot; in the definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncomputable function, since beauty appears to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prospective attribute: the function to recognize or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate beautiful things cannot be finitely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specified.
</em><br>
<p>I don't like where this is going.  We can't develop coherent plans for 
<br>
achieving something we can't define.  I doubt (and hope) that 
<br>
&quot;friendiness&quot; is not such a function.  Otherwise, it boils down to 
<br>
&quot;friendliness is in the eye of the beholder&quot;.  You end up saying that 
<br>
people will call the system friendly if they like it and unfriendly if 
<br>
they don't.  You can't engineer to such a spec, and it ends up being a 
<br>
democracy with people voting on what they want for friendliness.  If 
<br>
you can't define it precisely, how can it be a requirement?  How do you 
<br>
know it even exists, if you don't know what it is?  This isn't some 
<br>
observation that we haven't pinned down an explanation for yet.  This 
<br>
is our instructions and requirements to people trying to build AI 
<br>
systems.  How can our request be vague and ill-defined, but we'll know 
<br>
it when we see it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if the Omega Point condition holds for our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe, then the function can be defined to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one that a super-intelligence (Universal Mind) would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold, in the limit that the rate of information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing was approaching infinity (Omega Point).  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all concepts can be thought of as 'utility functions'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the universal mind.
</em><br>
<p>Again, circular logic.  You define the universe as mind.  Everything is 
<br>
in the universe (which equals mind, which equals universal mind).  
<br>
Therefore everything is in this universal mind.  Therefore all concepts 
<br>
are held in this mind.  Therefore a concept is what this universal mind 
<br>
holds.  There are no definitions here.  You are stating circular 
<br>
relationships and tautologies that do not distinguish between items 
<br>
within the definition and items without it.
<br>
<p>At the point where the information processing approaches infinity, you 
<br>
assume it holds everything.  Thus, what you say for concepts would 
<br>
apply to anything and everything else I might want to apply it to.  
<br>
There is nothing that wouldn't be defined in such a definition of 
<br>
infinity.
<br>
<p>(On an unrelated tangent, I reject the notion that infinity = 
<br>
everything.  A number-line of intergers from 1, 2, 3....infinity is 
<br>
infinite, but it does not encode any information besides sequential 
<br>
numbers.  Even though it is an infinite string of digits, there are no 
<br>
binary pictures, words, messages, concepts or information encoded in 
<br>
there.  This infinite sequence if relatively empty.  Infinite 
<br>
processing may or may not contain much of anything.  I have a similar 
<br>
objection to Many Worlds.  Even if their are infinite dimensions, it 
<br>
does not mean that all conceivable possibilities must exist.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * Propositions:  All concepts in reality can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted as utility functions.  'Friendliness' is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept; therefore Friendliness is a utility function.
</em><br>
<p>This is not a proposition.  You are labeling something with a name you 
<br>
want to call it.  This is not the same thing as defining it or 
<br>
explaining it.  A label is not a testable theory.  There is no validity 
<br>
or truth test as to whether these things are what you say or not.  You 
<br>
merely coined a term.  Besides using circular logic to reach this 
<br>
point, you still haven't defined it.  You merely labeled it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The class of friendly sentients appears to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially infinite, making 'Friendliness' a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prospective attribute.  Therefore the exact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friendliness utility function is uncomputable.
</em><br>
<p>The first part of you sentence says &quot;it appears...&quot;, then you jump to a 
<br>
more assertive &quot;making....&quot;   Vague appearances don't make anything 
<br>
true.  This argument is beyond weak.  It doesn't actually explain 
<br>
anything at all.
<br>
<p>The last sentence seem to sum up most of your &quot;definition&quot;.  Instead of 
<br>
giving a strong definition, you seem to be spending most of your words 
<br>
giving excuses for the weakness of any definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore all finite approximations to 'Friendliness'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must have the property that they are recursive and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; converge on the ideal utility function.
</em><br>
<p>The only thing you have defined in the end is that friendliness is 
<br>
recursive.  This is not a definition either.  It is an implementation 
<br>
method for encoding the process toward friendliness.  This is about as 
<br>
useful as defining Bayes Theorem as being mathematical notation.  It 
<br>
tells us how it is implemented or expressed, but tells us nothing about 
<br>
what you are implementing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let Partial Friendly (PF) = finitely specified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation to the Friendliness function.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Omega Friendly (OF) = exact Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function (uncomputable)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PF must be a recursive function such that PF (PF)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outputs PF’ which approaches OF as number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iterations approaches infinity.
</em><br>
<p>Assigning variables (or abbreviations) to terms sounds like a lead into 
<br>
a rigorous definition, like a mathematical formula or technical 
<br>
specification.  But you fizzle off and don't actually use these 
<br>
abbreviations you define.  They sound good, and look rigorous, but 
<br>
aren't actually used anything.  This is about as useful as padding a 
<br>
glossary with technical words that aren't actually used.  It adds 
<br>
nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Definition of Friendliness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A computable 'Friendly' function (PF) is a function
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which takes any finitely specified function Partial x
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as input and modifies it such that the outputted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; function Partial x' is a better approximation to Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; x.   Successive output used as input for the next
</em><br>
<em>&gt; iteration has to cause Partial x' to converge on Omega
</em><br>
<em>&gt; x as the number of iterations approaches infinity.
</em><br>
<p>This definition of &quot;friendliness&quot; merely says it is will have a 
<br>
recursive implementation.  There is no definition here.  You have 
<br>
described one attribute (recursiveness) of another attribute 
<br>
(friendliness) without defining that other attribute.  There is also no 
<br>
measurement method of friendliness here, to calculate how friendly we 
<br>
are getting.  Nor is there a test to define whether we are friendly or 
<br>
not.
<br>
<p>Any recursive function, such as factorial, would seem to meet your 
<br>
definition above.  As such, it fails to define or distinguish between 
<br>
friendly and non-friendly items.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; None the less, I think my understanding has improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the point where I at least understand in general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms what the concept 'Friendliness' mean.  So here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had a go at attempting to give, in my own words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a technical definition of 'Friendliness'.  Admittedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's only a very general definition, but I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's vacuous or gibberish.  That is, I think I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually defining something meaningful here.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree by all means please tell me.
</em><br>
<p>No offense, but I think this is close to gibberish.  It consists of 
<br>
tautologies that each might make sense, but they go nowhere.  You also 
<br>
contradict yourself by claiming to give a &quot;technical definition&quot; but 
<br>
only as a &quot;very general definition&quot;.  It can't be both the technical or 
<br>
rigorous definition and general at the same time.  You can't give a 
<br>
&quot;technical definition&quot; in your own words.  Not only have you failed to 
<br>
give a definition (IMHO), but you are not even clear about the goals or 
<br>
what you are claiming to present here.
<br>
<p>I see no or few definitions here at all.  I am not even sure if you and 
<br>
I would agree on what a definition is or what it is supposed to do.  
<br>
But by my understanding, you are not defining, and what you are doing 
<br>
fails to achieve any goal of a definition.  Maybe you are trying to 
<br>
invent terminology instead?  Maybe you are giving a background or 
<br>
context in which friendliness must exist?  Maybe you are describing 
<br>
goals, principles, constraints, assumptions, methodology, or some other 
<br>
attribute besides definition of this concept?
<br>
<p>I would be curious to see Eliezer's take on this &quot;definition&quot; of 
<br>
friendliness.  If you gave it to him using a term other than 
<br>
&quot;friendliness&quot;, would he even recognize it as describing the same thing 
<br>
that he frequently talks about?
<br>
<p>Again, please excuse my bluntness.  But if I were editing your work, 
<br>
this would be my critique.  If I were an engineer handed such a 
<br>
definition or requirement, this would be my response.  And please 
<br>
realize that I am not just complaining about it not being in the right 
<br>
form or terminology that I like to see.  In my career, I work with 
<br>
customers all the time translating their vague notions into rigorous 
<br>
engineering specs.  But I cannot extract any useful guidance out of 
<br>
what you have written.  I have a similar problem with much AI and 
<br>
transhumanist writings, which tend to be more philosophy than anything 
<br>
else.  In many cases, it isn't even philosophy, it is just attitude.
