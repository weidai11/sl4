<em>&gt; you only need a 1 in 10^20 chance that a planet would evolve intelligent
</em><br>
life to explain our presence
<br>
But that is exactly the point, we're not debating our own presence, we're
<br>
debating why we can't see evidence other presences, why can't we see any of
<br>
advanced stellar technologies - and one idea is that, even though life may
<br>
be highly common, and that intelligence may be fairly common (substitute
<br>
your own magnifier at will) - it seems to be the cold hard fact at this
<br>
stage that galaxy spanning civilizations are NOT common, if they exist at
<br>
all.
<br>
So somewhere, assuming a high probability of intelligence evolving,
<br>
intelligence falters - and hence we have The Great Silence. But what I was
<br>
getting at, is that The Great Silence might be explained by the fact that an
<br>
AGI wouldn't NEED to colonize the cosmos:
<br>
<p>0) It's not driven by the same impulse to reproduce as we are.
<br>
1) It can observe quite a lot from here.
<br>
2) All the laws of physics are the same as anywhere else, so it can figure
<br>
them out just fine without ever having to leave its armchair (so to speak).
<br>
3) Once it has all them pesky laws figured out, it can go ahead and simulate
<br>
the universe, thus making traveling pretty pointless.
<br>
4) If, having garnered all it can from staying put, it were inclined to
<br>
travel - it could do so much more inconspicuously than an stellar explosion
<br>
of biomass, which Hanson's model seems to imply.
<br>
<p>So we might have a framework in which the Singularity gives us loophole
<br>
through Fermi's Paradox.
<br>
<p>As for the rate of intelligence, I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say
<br>
that I think that there is a lower limit of scale somewhere, where an
<br>
intelligence becomes too slow to be able to respond to its environment in
<br>
any meaningful way rendering an attribution of intelligence somewhat
<br>
suspect, but then again, if something were to communicate at a bit per
<br>
millennium - communicating with it would not so much depend on the speed of
<br>
thought, but rather of the attention span of the faster intelligence - I
<br>
feel I'm stepping on some thin ice here, so I'm gonna leave it at that.
<br>
<p>kind regards,
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Hi sl4.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Short self-deprecating 1st post intro: My name is Gissur and I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from Iceland, I've been lurking for a while, but I thought I'd finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contribute (even if it's just a glorified link).)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well - seeing as how point number 5 is beyond the singularity - we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; free to speculate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Robin Hanson tackles this point from a slightly different perspective in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paper; The Great Filter - Are We Almost Past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It?&lt;<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/greatfilter.html</a>&gt;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He argues that the evolution of mankind consists of numerous discreet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; steps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which he describes a &quot;best-guess evolutionary path to an explosion which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leads to visible colonization of most of the visible universe&quot;. He then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on to discuss that each of these steps could constitute The Great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Filter, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obstacle so great, that evolution has yet to tackle it, thus explaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Great Silence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This of course raises the Very Important Question: Are we past the Great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Filter? Because if we aren't we'd better look out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This also raises the question whether an AGI would be as interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Extraterrestrials as we humans seem to be, because if I we CAN find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for it NOT to be, we might have found a plausible way to sidestep the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Great Filter/Great Silence issue - namely, that once an AGI reaches a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certain level of processing power (however this power comes to be) it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doesn't really need to go anywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Assuming an AGI is primarily an infovore, I'd think that it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable to say that it would want to know everything it can know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; risking interstellar exploration, and given how we like to think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; physics work the same way everywhere in the universe, it could probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a lot out just by staying. Maybe it'd need to build a dyson sphere,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not. Maybe it would find some source of energy unknown to us, anyway -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm basically saying is that the constant of colonization, which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ascribe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to all life, need not apply to an AGI, since a lot of the principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; drive OUR exploration don't necessarily apply (namely competition and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scarcity of resources).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm sorry if this has all been covered before, and I also apologize if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; raving.
