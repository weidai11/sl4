<p>The Worlds Oldest Stone Artefacts from Gona, Ethiopia: Their
<br>
Implications for Understanding Stone Technology and Patterns
<br>
of Human Evolution Between 2615 Million Years Ago
<br>
<p>Abstract.
<br>
<p>&quot;The systematic archaeological and geological survey and excavations at 
<br>
Gona between 19921994 led to the discovery
<br>
of well-flaked stone artefacts which are currently the oldest known from 
<br>
anywhere in the world. More than 3000 surface
<br>
and excavated artefacts
<br>
<p><em>&gt;All of which we developed before
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writing.  I think the evidence is pretty strong that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Neanderthals did not have general purpose symbolic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation ability.  There is no evidence that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;did, but the evidence for Homo Sapiens is abundant.
</em><br>
<p>There was a study I can't locate just now of just how hard it is to chip 
<br>
the kind of tools the Neanderthals made.  (The study was in the context of 
<br>
how important language was in teaching about how to chip rocks.  Didn't 
<br>
seem to be.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Even chimps have a certain degree of culture that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;varies from place to place.  It is hard to say just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exactly when people became critically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dependant on culture.  It could have been carrying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unworked stones to drive off major predators.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decide worked stone to be the boundary, then we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;talking about 2.6 million years ago.&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think you missed his point.  He is talking about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;first level of abstraction (i.e. logos) - a symbol, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grunt, a word, or picture, *representing* something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Basic survival knowledge is not abstraction, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;visceral experience that happens with every species,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even the amoeba on some level.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;We, as a species, have been driven by memes for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;last hundred thousand years, and this has forced us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;further and further away from any direct connection
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;with the natural world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Until we can live on electric power, this is a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overstated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How is it overstated?  Right now, sitting at your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computer in your house or apartment, your are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surrounded by artificiality, lights, tools, batteries,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kitchen knives, oven, roof, walls, windows, glass,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cars, telephone polls, the spoken word, TV,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;newspapers, soda pop, running water, pipes, etc, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We are practically drowning in logos!
</em><br>
<p>You bet.  But consider:  During an ice age environmental productivity (in 
<br>
modern terms read farm output) might well fall by 50% or more.  How much do 
<br>
you think the human population would fall under such conditions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;So we have three waves, biological, linguistic, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;technological, which are rapidly moving to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;concrescence, and on their way, as they interact,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;produce such a tsunami of novelty as has never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;been experienced in the history of this planet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The real question is &quot;does anything interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;survive&quot;?  (Where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;entities able to tame wild galaxies &gt;are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;interesting.&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, that would be a very desirable outcome! :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;*If* technophilic life is common then the answer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*no.*  Our chances are really rotten if the last 10 or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;100 million species to reach this state were eaten by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gray goo or unfriendly AIs.  If species that reach our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stage are so rare that there are none in our light
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cone, then the future is unknown.  Scary perhaps, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not a death sentence.&lt;&lt;&lt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Of course, but as you pointed out, as far as we know,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this process has [only] been centered on a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;small planet.
</em><br>
<p>True.  We don't see anything.  This could be because there isn't anything 
<br>
to see because no civilization besides ours have arisen inside out light 
<br>
cone or that the local singularity kills every single one of them.
<br>
<p>There just isn't any evidence one way or the other and the universe is 
<br>
going to look the same either way.
<br>
<p>But the more hostile the rest of the universe looks, the better the chances 
<br>
are that we are alone.
