Hey guys. This is my first post. I too am a philosopher and I have a few
<br>
comments about this thesis. First as to eliminative materialism. I agree
<br>
that this thesis is patently ridiculous for the obvious reason that qualia
<br>
are phenomenologically observable from the first person. I just don't see
<br>
how anyone can argue against what is before their own eyes. The real
<br>
question at hand is the causal relationship between qualia and the nervous
<br>
system. This is a much more difficult question. I have to admit that I
<br>
really didn't quite understand David's thesis. I am familiar with dual
<br>
aspect monism but this business of the relationship between mathematical
<br>
Platonism and qualia didn't make sense to me. I'm not saying its wrong just
<br>
that it needs to be explained better. Having said that from what I did
<br>
understand it seems that you are advocating some form of epiphenomenalism.
<br>
If this is the case then whether or not an AI experiences qualia is a
<br>
superfluous question. You can't design consciousness into a machine. If
<br>
consciousness and the corresponding qualia happen to be an emergent property
<br>
of sufficiently intelligent entities then so be it. But the fact of the
<br>
matter is that you will never be able to test if a machine is experiencing
<br>
qualia but can certainly test for general intelligence.
<br>
<p>The question I would put forth is, given that human beings experience
<br>
qualia, what role does such qualia play in intelligence? I can't imagine
<br>
that something like a platonic form is in any way related to qualia. Qualia
<br>
is merely the name given to phenomenal conscious experience. It is, for
<br>
instance, the redness of red. This is not a universal property. I can easily
<br>
imagine an intelligent species or AI that does not experience 'redness' yet
<br>
is intelligent. On the other hand the Platonic form of Oneness or
<br>
singularity (no pun intended) is a Universal Idea that is required for any
<br>
kind of intelligent thought. Thus it makes sense to say that if a being has
<br>
human level intelligence then it must also understand a principle of oneness
<br>
(or some such notion). So if you follow what I'm saying the Platonic Forms
<br>
are the very blue print of rationality whereas qualia may be something that
<br>
is merely contingent and a happenstance of the intelligence of human beings.
<br>
<p><p>As for my theory on the subject I do not have any kind of solution worked
<br>
out. To be quite honest I find the problem of consciousness to be baffling.
<br>
But I have come to certain conclusions. First, not only do I find
<br>
eliminative materialism to be an obviously false philosophy of mind but I
<br>
find the entire metaphysics of materialism wanting. Materialism is an
<br>
outmoded way of thinking that relies on the principles of reductionism. The
<br>
problem with this is that there is no bottom level causal substrate. This
<br>
kind of thinking is a leftover over of the billiard ball physics of another
<br>
age. What I propose is a more process way of thinking such as is found in
<br>
the philosophy of A.N. Whitehead. Once we back away from the
<br>
reductionist/materialist models of causation we can begin to view causal
<br>
structures through non-linear dynamics. My hunch is that there are many
<br>
different substrates out of which intelligence can arise. Some of these
<br>
substrates might be conscious some might not. Therefor I think that AI
<br>
theorists need not worry about this metaphysical issue but rather need to
<br>
focus on how to build a machine that has intelligent behavior. If the
<br>
behavior of the machine is intelligent then it is intelligent. Whether or
<br>
not it experiences qualia will never be known and is probably of no
<br>
consequence.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments here it is below - (of course you David
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won't understand a word because you're obviously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally ignorant of the rudiments of philosophy).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an edited forwarding of a posting I made on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another messageboards which clearly explains why I so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly disagree with the currrent Sing Inst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The comparison between 'Qualia' and 'Numbers' is well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made.  Because the same general kinds of philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments that are made about phenomenological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities also apply to mathematical entities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If I could just ask: Where does the number '4' exist?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is the proof of 'Fermat's Last Theorem' real or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction?  If the proof is real, is it part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causal processes taking place in the brain?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about other mathematical entities?  Are they real or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction?  How do they fit into physical causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you can see that the 'Qualia' question is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as clear cut as (some) are making out.  Again, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are prepared to believe in the objective existence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical entities, and if you agree that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relationship between mathematical entities and causal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain-networks is not a direct one, then why could the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same not be true for Qualia?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course it's trivially true that all metaphysical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities have to be related to causal processes *in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some sense* (in order to produce observable effects).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this by itself establishes little.  It doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow that all metaphysical entities are fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reducible to descriptions in terms of *physical*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality at all - where I am here defining physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality as: 'cause and effect relations between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objects with spatial extensions and the forces and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motions associated with these objects'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To try to explain away Qualia by demanding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything be fully describable in terms of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality is simply to presuppose the very thing you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are trying to prove (circular reasoning).  A believer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Qualia could easily rebut simply by redefining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of 'causality' and demanding that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything be explained, not in terms of physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causality, but in terms of direct experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now it *may* well prove to be the case that talk of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Qualia can be eliminated and replaced entirely by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanations in terms of physical causality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (eliminative materialism).  But it may not.  The facts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the matter can only be determined through a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combination of theory and observation, just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else in science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose for instance that there's some kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental law of cognitive science and information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory such that no explanation phrased entirely in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms of physical causality can fully predict sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior?  For instance suppose that for some *in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle* theoretical reason computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intractability prevents accurate real-time predictions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sentient behavior if these predictions are phrased
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely in terms of physical processes?  Suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in order to achieve an accurate model of sentient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior one needs to introduce mental concepts into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's explanations right from the start - i.e. suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is an *in principle* requirement?  Then one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to conclude that some mental concepts are just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'real' and fundamental as physical ones. So you see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the philosophical arguments advanced in this thread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Qualia have to be a part of the 'causal networks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the brain' don't prove a thing about Qualia one way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the other.  On the contrary, the argument is weak,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I have shown by pointing out examples of abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities (mathematical concepts) that many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Platonists) take to be objectivity real, yet clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't directly fit into the causal networks of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The philosophical position known as 'Eliminative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialism'(the idea that 'qualia' don't exist but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are simply misrepresentations of what are really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely material processes – which seems to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position Eliezer (is) arguing for) is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments by philosophers Paul and Patricia Churchland
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Daniel Dennett (in fact the position traces back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to earlier arguments by philosophers Paul Feyerabend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an d Quine), to the effect: that (a) qualia are simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract (or theoretical entities) and (b) should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replaced by the objective scientific viewpoint.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the argument undermines itself.  *Of course* I believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that 'Qualia' are 'theoretical abstractions' and *of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course* I agree that the correct view-point requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an objective scientific account, but the conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Qualia are fictions doesn't follow from (a) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) at all!  It's a total non-sequitur.  In fact the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very arguments applied by Eliminative materialism to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue *against* Qualia can be used to argue for them!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let look at the first argument of the Qualia skeptics:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) 'Qualia' are abstractions.  I say, of course they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are!  But this doesn't prove a thing against Qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the contrary, we could take a Platonic view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these abstractions just as some philosophers do for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics.  In fact what I was suggesting was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just that Qualia are *similar* to mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities, but that Qualia are in fact *identical* to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical entities.  That is to say, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical entities are just Qualia from a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the reason we're all so confused about Qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is due to a limitation of the human brain - as others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have pointed out - we can't *see* qualia from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective perspective, only a subjective one.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows skeptics to claim that they're fictional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities and all that exists are material processes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as gts rightly pointed out, the fact we can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view Qualia subjectively doesn't mean that Qualia are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not objectively real.  Eliezer of all people should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have known better.  The argument against Qualia is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based solely on a limitation of the *human* brain and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is folly to suppose that this limitation applies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds in general.  The fact that *we* (humans) can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only ever view Qualia from a subjective perspective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not mean that more advanced minds couldn't view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them from an *objective* perspective. Now the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain does not appear to be capable of direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perception of mathematical entities.  I think if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human brain *was* so capable, it would be obvious to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone that Qualia and mathematical entities are one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the same i.e. we would be having second-order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Qualia capable of objectively viewing first-order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Qualia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If it's possible to objectivity view Qualia, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second argument of the Qualia skeptics is also exposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a total non-sequitur.  Recall that the eliminative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialists argue that (b) The most accurate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view-point of something is the objective scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view-point.  The believer in Qualia can just say: well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course I agree with (b), but so what?  For *Qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves are a part of objective science* !  As I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested earlier, if it proves that accurate models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of sentient behaviour are *in principle* impossible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without introducing mental concepts into one's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanations (perhaps due to some theorem involving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computational intractability), then one would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that some mental concepts are just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamental and real as physical concepts and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ontology of objective science would have to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadened to include these mental concepts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you see, both the arguments of Eliminative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialists are simply without philosophical merit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if Qualia and mathematical entities are equivalent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I claim and if as I said, the human brain is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capable of direct perception of mathematical entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then how is it that we have qualia at all?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer, I think, lies in the truth of mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Platonism.  The human brain cannot directly generate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceptions of mathematical entities, but if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematics is *out there* in reality, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions of the brain will still *indirectly* involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mathematical relations (since according to Platonism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math is the fabric of reality itself).  Hence even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without explicit modeling of mathematical entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there can still be *indirect* Qualia associated with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain.  Clever eh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you familiar with Bertrand Russell's theory of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Dual-aspect monism' ?  Well basically, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical theory is vaguely like that, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended to a more complex 'Seven-fold-aspect monism'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the Dual-aspect monism of Russell, the *Intrinsic*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; properties of reality were equated with mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts, and the *Relational* properties of reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were equated with physical concepts.  But in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, I have Seven different general 'aspects'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of just the two of the original Russell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory.  My core idea, as I've explained, is to equate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Qualia wih mathematical entities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Panpsychism is a secondary consequence of my theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whilst critics of Panpsychism are right to point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Panpsychism *by itself* doesn't explain anything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is perfectly logically acceptable to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Panpsychism emerging as a *secondary consequence* of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's metaphysics i.e. a theorem of a deeper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanatory theory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sooner or later someone smarter than me will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently discover the principles of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mathematico-Cognition Reality Theory (MCRT) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; develop them in rigorous mathematical way.  When that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens, the arguments of the Qualia skeptics will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collapse, and with them the entire rotten edifice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the current AGI paradigm will crumple  (including the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculous ideas that you can have general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence without qualia, that reasoning is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely reducible to Bayes etc).
