New Chip Mimics Human Brain

<br>
<p>Scientists have developed an electronic circuit that mimics the wiring
<br>
of the human brain in some ways - an achievement that could
<br>
revolutionize computer science and improve understanding of how nature's
<br>
most powerful processor works. 
<br>
The circuit, built on a silicon chip the size of a fingernail, is far
<br>
from the thinking machines of science fiction. For one thing, it cannot
<br>
learn, the way the brain can. 
<br>
But researchers say it could result in better speech and object
<br>
recognition by computers. 
<br>
``This is a demonstration of whats possible when circuits compute in
<br>
biological ways,创 said Rahul Sarpeshkar, a computer science
<br>
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked on the
<br>
project. ``Were still far away from building a brain.创 
<br>
The findings were published in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature. 
<br>
The project is the culmination of more than two decades of work using
<br>
transistors and silicon to mimic the natural circuitry in the brain. It
<br>
is the first time a circuit inspired by the brain's cortex has been
<br>
created in hardware. 
<br>
Traditional circuits work in one of two ways: They are either digital
<br>
and specific such as computer processors, or analog and nonspecific like
<br>
radio amplifiers. Research suggests the brain is able to do digital and
<br>
analog computing at the same time. 
<br>
Someone watching a highway, for instance, can sort out distinct objects
<br>
like a police cruiser, and also perceive changes in direction, speed and
<br>
color. Traditional digital circuits in computers are not nearly as
<br>
efficient as the brain in perceptual tasks. 
<br>
The latest research, done at Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs in New
<br>
Jersey, combines both digital and analog processing by using artificial
<br>
neurons that either excite or inhibit each other based on responses, or
<br>
feedback, from other neurons. 
<br>
``In one simultaneous circuit, both digital selection and analog
<br>
amplification can co-exist,创 Sarpeshkar said. 
<br>
Researchers applied simultaneous electrical currents to two artificial
<br>
neurons in their circuit. It selected the stronger of the stimuli and
<br>
suppressed its response to the weaker. That is not unlike, say, a frog
<br>
choosing which of two flies to eat, the researchers said. 
<br>
And the circuit, like a brain, maintained its selection as the weaker
<br>
current was increased and the stronger decreased. 
<br>
Another unique aspect of the circuit is that no single element made the
<br>
decision. 
<br>
``If you take a Pentium chip and cut a single wire, then it would
<br>
probably stop functioning,创 said Richard Hahnloser, another MIT
<br>
researcher. ``If you took our circuit, you could cut a wire and it would
<br>
still work the same.创 
<br>
It will be at least 50 years before artificial neural circuitry
<br>
approaches the abilities of the brain and its 240 billion neurons,
<br>
Sarpeshkar said. 
<br>
But even simple circuits are useful in demonstrating how biological
<br>
networks operate, said Dean Buonomano, a neurobiology professor at the
<br>
University of California at Los Angeles.
