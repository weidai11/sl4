NEW APPROACH TO AGI!
<br>
UNIVERSAL MORALITY - A NEW PROPOSAL!
<br>
NEW GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE could potentially:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(1) Solve the puzzle of consciousness
<br>
(2) Provide the basis for a 'Universal Morality'
<br>
-answer the meaning of life
<br>
(3) Solve the puzzle of time
<br>
(4) Revolutionize metaphysics by providing a new
<br>
understanding of mathematics, mind, matter and the
<br>
relationship between the 3
<br>
(5) Provide a strategy for completing string theory
<br>
and hence achieving a theory of quantum gravity
<br>
(6)  Provide the first firm mathematical framework for
<br>
complex systems theory
<br>
(7)  Solve the puzzles of quantum mechanics and
<br>
revolutionize science by pointing the way to entirely
<br>
new non-reductionistic laws of which QM would be a
<br>
special case
<br>
(8)  Introduce an entirely new understanding of
<br>
mathematics which would revolutionize number theory
<br>
and could lead to a strategy capable of solving the
<br>
Riemann hypothesis - the deepest problem in pure
<br>
mathematics
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A statement of the general principles of the TOE
<br>
follows below.  These principles really require a book
<br>
length exposition.  Since this is a posting suitable
<br>
for message board, what follows is only a very brief
<br>
but clear summary.  This is followed by a summary of
<br>
how these principles have been applied to problems (1)
<br>
and (2) named above - the puzzle of consciousness and
<br>
the universal morality.  There are only very brief
<br>
summaries of how the theory could attack problems
<br>
(3)-(8).  These other problems (not directly relevant
<br>
to AGI work) are touched upon in order to provide
<br>
evidence for the potentially explanatory power of the
<br>
theory in order to bolster the case for the proposed
<br>
solution to the puzzle of consciousness and Universal
<br>
Morality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
PRINCIPLES OF THE TOE
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(A) 3-dimensional multiversal time
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The proposal is that there are 3 time dimensions. 
<br>
There is nothing 'mystical' about extra time
<br>
dimensions.  The idea can be given a clear scientific
<br>
interpretation in terms of the multiverse.  One simply
<br>
imagines extending the extra time dimensions
<br>
'sideways' across the multiverse from our current time
<br>
line.  Extra time dimensions have been proposed by
<br>
several eminent scientists, including cosmologist
<br>
Stephen Hawking (Imaginary time) and physicist Cumrun
<br>
Vafa (12-dimensional F-theory variant of string
<br>
theory).  Unfortunately however, these proposals have
<br>
tended to flounder because there has been no clear way
<br>
to interpret the physical meaning of processes in
<br>
other time dimensions.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(B)  3 kinds of causality - Mathematical, Volitional
<br>
and Functional
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE offers a radically new way to interpret
<br>
the meaning of extra time dimensions.  Rather than
<br>
giving each time dimension a standard physical
<br>
interpretation, the idea is that there are 3 quite
<br>
different kinds of causality (cause and effect), each
<br>
corresponding a 'movement' through one of the 3 time
<br>
dimensions
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(B) i  Mathematical Causality:  The idea here is to
<br>
interpret the steps of a mathematical proof as a
<br>
causal process through a higher time dimension.  The
<br>
evidence for this is the fact that there exist
<br>
mathematical entities (for instance Transfinite
<br>
numbers, uncomputable and infinitesimals) which cannot
<br>
be fit into ordinary empirical reality.  All entities
<br>
in ordinary empirical reality are believed to be
<br>
computable and finite (by the principles of string
<br>
theory and the holographic principle) where as the
<br>
aforementioned mathematical entities are not.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(B) ii  Volitional Causality:   The idea here is to
<br>
interpret a volitional agent as a series of mental
<br>
events defined as a causal process in another time
<br>
dimension.  The evidence is that when dealing with
<br>
mental concepts we appear to be dealing with concepts
<br>
not easily reducible to fundamental physics.  For
<br>
instance questions of volitional choices are concerned
<br>
with morality and decision theory, where as physics
<br>
questions are concerned with prediction.  Of course it
<br>
may be that the two classes of concepts are completely
<br>
equivalent, but if so, why the sharp delineation in
<br>
the two areas (physics and morality)?  It seems a
<br>
natural step, following the idea of 'Mathematical
<br>
Causality' to postulate an analogous 'Volitional
<br>
Causality' which extends through another time
<br>
dimension.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(B) iii Functional Causality:  This is the ordinary
<br>
physics kind of causality - a physical process of a
<br>
functional system, or equivalently (by the principle
<br>
of universal computation) a series of computational
<br>
steps.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We identity three kinds of metaphysical 'worlds' - the
<br>
Mathematical, the Volitional and the Physical.  The
<br>
Geddes TOE proposes that each of these be interpreted
<br>
as an extension in an actual real time dimension
<br>
across the multiverse: mathematical causality
<br>
corresponds a movement through one time dimension - we
<br>
interpret this as 'a mathematical proof', volitional
<br>
causality corresponds to a movement through a second
<br>
time dimension - we interpret this as 'a meme' , and
<br>
functional causality is simply good old ordinary
<br>
movement through physics time - we interpret this as
<br>
an ordered physical process.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(C)  Reality as a complex system of pure information
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The idea here dates back to John Wheeler and has a
<br>
natural interpretation in terms of modern information
<br>
theory.  The idea is that we interpret reality from
<br>
the point of view of 'Informational Data Structures' -
<br>
we pretend that reality is a 'program' or even a sort
<br>
of 'mind', and treat the things within reality as
<br>
'Data' (pure information).  We can then ask what sorts
<br>
of Information reality consists of.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE proposes that reality is composed of
<br>
three interacting 'Complex Systems'.  A complex system
<br>
is a system composed of many parts interacting
<br>
together in an ordered way, such that there are
<br>
different 'levels of organization' - whereby the
<br>
system displays high-level properties not completely
<br>
predictable in practice from it's low level
<br>
properties, due to strong feed-back from the higher
<br>
levels of the system. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes definition of 'Complex System' proposes to
<br>
define a Complex System as composed of three basic
<br>
kinds of Information:  Intrinsic, Relational and
<br>
Temporal.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Intrinsic:    The internal states of the basic
<br>
building blocks (or individual 'parts') of the system
<br>
*Relational: The relational properties between the
<br>
basic building blocks (how a system is put together)
<br>
*Temporal:  The causal properties of the system -
<br>
rules governing how the system evolves across time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The 'Temporal' component of the Complex System needs
<br>
some basic elaboration in order to understand the
<br>
Geddes TOE.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The definitions given imply that the '*Temporal*
<br>
aspect of a complex system depends on an ordered
<br>
relationship (or in mathematical jargon a 'mapping')
<br>
between the Intrinsic and Relational aspects.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Temporal =  Mapping (Intrinsic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Relational)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In order for a system to 'evolve' across time in an
<br>
ordered way, there has to be an ordered relationship
<br>
between the Intrinsic and Relational properties. 
<br>
Another way of putting this is that the Temporal
<br>
aspect of the Complex System is a *Function*
<br>
(Mathematical definition of that terms) mapping the
<br>
Intrinsic aspect to the Relational aspects.  The
<br>
'evolution' of the system across time is characterized
<br>
by an increase in the complexity of the system, so
<br>
defined.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE proposes that reality is composed of
<br>
the following 3 Complex Systems: The Mathematical
<br>
System, The Volitional System and The Physical System.
<br>
&nbsp;Definitions of these 3 terms were given earlier.  The
<br>
Mathematical system consists of *Mathematical proofs*,
<br>
the Volitional system consists of *Memes* and the
<br>
Physical system consists of *Computations* (Physics).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The above paragraph sounds very strange at first
<br>
hearing and requires some elaboration.  It is
<br>
suggested that readers bear in mind the following two
<br>
points below, and then try re-reading the paragraph
<br>
again.  The above paragraph *is* in fact, completely
<br>
coherent.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Recall that the Geddes TOE proposed three 'time
<br>
dimensions' - one for 'mathematical causality'
<br>
(mathematical proofs), one for 'volitional causality'
<br>
(memes) and the third for 'functional causality'
<br>
(physics).  This offered a way in which Mathematical
<br>
entities and Memes could be interpreted as dynamic
<br>
systems.  In fact, the idea is that each of the time
<br>
dimensions be equated with the *Temporal* aspect of
<br>
the corresponding Complex System.  The *Temporal*
<br>
aspect of the complex system was defined as increase
<br>
in the complexity of the system.  This idea can now be
<br>
given an Informational interpretation - as the *growth
<br>
of knowledge* in an Information System.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Recall that the Geddes TOE proposed to consider
<br>
reality as 'pure information' (aka John Wheeler).  We
<br>
are pretending that reality is a 'program' or a kind
<br>
of 'mind¡¯ and this is what justifies the step of
<br>
dividing reality into 'Three Worlds' (Mathematical,
<br>
Volitional and Physical).  Whether or not these 'three
<br>
worlds' are reducible to one another is quite
<br>
irrelevant.  The fact is, that when we treat reality
<br>
as 'pure information', 3 kinds of fundamental 'data
<br>
types' appear - Mathematical propositions, Memes and
<br>
Physical states.  We are justified in treating each
<br>
kind of Information separately because that is what we
<br>
need to do in order to fully *explain* reality in
<br>
*informational* terms.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
When treated in terms of pure information and
<br>
considered as a Complex System, reality consists of
<br>
three complex systems.  By the definition of a Complex
<br>
System given earlier, each system in turn can be
<br>
sub-divided into 3 parts: Temporal, Intrinsic and
<br>
Relational, for a total of 9 fundamental kinds of
<br>
Information.  The Geddes TOE proposes to 'join' these
<br>
3 Complex Systems together into an integrated whole by
<br>
making two of the complex systems sub-systems of the
<br>
last.  Then reality is integrated in an aesthetically
<br>
pleasing way and 9 separate data types are reduced to
<br>
7.  The proposal is given below.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The scheme below is intended to be an *Informational*
<br>
representation of Reality.  Reality consists of three
<br>
general types of information - mathematical, memetic
<br>
and physical.  These are treated as three kinds of
<br>
complex system.  The terms *Temporal*, *Relational*
<br>
and *Intrinsic* were briefly defined earlier.  The
<br>
labels below refer to various kinds of proposed data
<br>
structures associated with these components of the
<br>
system.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Mathematics System
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Temporal  - Sets (Qualia)
<br>
*Relational - Memes (Morality)
<br>
*Intrinsic   -  Space-Time (Physics).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Sets* here refer to the standard mathematical
<br>
definition of the term - groupings of entities related
<br>
in some way.  Everything in math can be defined as a
<br>
set of some kind.
<br>
*Memes* is here referring to the Mereological sum (or
<br>
'collective') of all possible individual volitions
<br>
within reality
<br>
*Space-Time* is here referring to all possible
<br>
space-times (i.e. space-times in the multiversal
<br>
sense).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The system above is strategy for defining reality in
<br>
terms of 'all possible worlds'.  Clearly, it's a form
<br>
of Abstract and Modal realism, since abstract entities
<br>
are granted distinct ontological existence.  The
<br>
scheme proposes to equate the highest level (temporal)
<br>
aspect of reality with mathematical sets - which
<br>
include the space of all possible worlds.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The conception of universals here is Aristotelian in
<br>
spirit.  Abstract entities are contingent and
<br>
dependent on having one or more instances.  The
<br>
radical new step is to define abstract entities as
<br>
processes on a 'Super time-line' (mathematical or
<br>
multiversal time).  The scheme is closest to David
<br>
Lewis's concrete worlds model (CWM), since all
<br>
possible space-times are granted concrete existence. 
<br>
But it also has some similarities to the abstract
<br>
worlds model (AWM) of Alvin Plantinga, since the
<br>
highest level units of reality  (abstract mathematical
<br>
entities) are seen to be constructed from the mapping
<br>
(or relationship) between all possible space-times and
<br>
all possible volitions.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The key thesis of this scheme is that 'consistency'
<br>
alone is insufficient to ensure 'existence'.  Because
<br>
abstract entities are defined as events on a 'super
<br>
time-line', the entities have to be connected in a
<br>
logical way that goes beyond mere consistency.  The
<br>
proposal is that 'Movement' along the mathematical
<br>
time-line corresponds to an *integration* of different
<br>
kinds of mathematical entity - this shall be called
<br>
'Consilience'.  The Geddes TOE therefore proposes that
<br>
mathematical existence requires both *Consistency* and
<br>
*Consilience*.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Volitional System
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Temporal  -  Morality (Memes)
<br>
*Relational -  Roles 
<br>
*Intrinsic    -  Situations
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Morality* here refers to a system of memes -
<br>
referring to the generic series of external behaviors
<br>
consciously selected by a volitional agent
<br>
*Roles* here refer to the common usage of the term -
<br>
the roles volitional agents choose to play (e.g. 
<br>
Teacher, Doctor)
<br>
*Situations* are sets of logical activities happening
<br>
in the external world - things happening *to* a
<br>
volitional agent.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The system above is a strategy for defining a
<br>
volitional agent.  It says that a volitional agent is
<br>
defined by a series of mental events (composed of
<br>
memes 'chosen' or 'not chosen' to be acted upon),
<br>
which is composed of the relationship between the
<br>
roles played by an agent and the situations the agent
<br>
found itself in.  This scheme is part of what could be
<br>
called a 'Two Category Theory'.  Ontological reality
<br>
has been granted to the concept an 'agent', as
<br>
distinct from the concept of mere matter.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Physical System
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Temporal - Physics (Space-Time)
<br>
*Relational- Forces (Dynamical Operators)
<br>
*Intrinsic   - Geometry 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Physics* here refers to a functional process - a
<br>
system passing through a succession of on/off states.
<br>
*Forces* here refers to the effect one body has on
<br>
another in terms of physical force
<br>
*Geometry* here refers to the physical states of the
<br>
spatial continuum - including mass and energy
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The system above is a strategy for defining a physical
<br>
space-time (and any sub-set thereof).  It says that a
<br>
space-time slice is defined as a series of
<br>
computational events composed of the relationship (or
<br>
mapping) between the geometrical properties of the
<br>
spatial continuum and the dynamical properties
<br>
(physical forces).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This is a scheme that really requires a book length
<br>
exposition of terms to be fully comprehensible, but
<br>
briefly here:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Mathematical system refers to reality as a whole -
<br>
the multiverse - including all possible worlds - and
<br>
any sub-set thereof.    A Volitional system refers to
<br>
the mental states of a particular volitional agent. 
<br>
And a Physical system refers to the physical states of
<br>
a particular space-time - and any sub-set thereof. 
<br>
These systems can be interpreted multiversally in
<br>
terms of the three time dimensions proposed by the
<br>
Geddes TOE.  The *Temporal* aspect of each system
<br>
corresponds to a time dimension.  For instance looking
<br>
across the Mathematical time dimension in the
<br>
multiverse would be equivalent to viewing the growth
<br>
of mathematical knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Note how all three systems are linked together by the
<br>
Geddes TOE.  Volitional and Physical systems are
<br>
sub-systems of the Mathematical system.  The set of
<br>
all the *Temporal* aspects of the Volitional systems
<br>
(i.e. all possible volitions) is the *Relational*
<br>
aspect of the Mathematical system.  And the set of all
<br>
the *Temporal* aspects of the Physical system (i.e.
<br>
all possible space-times) is the *Intrinsic* aspect of
<br>
the Mathematical system.  This should be interpreted
<br>
as representing the fact that Mathematics is a higher
<br>
dimensional time which binds together the two lower
<br>
dimensional times (Physics and Morality).  Recall that
<br>
the *Temporal* aspect of a Complex System is the
<br>
mapping function between the *Intrinsic* and
<br>
*Relational* aspects of the system (see earlier
<br>
discussion of a complex system).  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
This completes the (very brief) summary of the basic
<br>
principles of the Geddes TOE.  Obviously this skeleton
<br>
outline would require a book length exposition to
<br>
qualify as a real theory, but the general principles
<br>
outlined are clear, concise and coherent.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We shall now outline how these principles could be
<br>
applied to solve the puzzle of consciousness (qualia)
<br>
and establish the basis for a Universal Morality.
<br>
&nbsp;

<br>
earlier

<br>
Solving the puzzle of consciousness
<br>
Establishing the basis for Universal Morality
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*The nature of Qualia
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The scheme introduced in (C) proposes a solution as to
<br>
the nature of Qualia (consciousness).  Qualia are
<br>
proposed to be identical (or equivalent) to the
<br>
*Temporal* aspect of the Mathematical system.   Note
<br>
that this was proposed to be: Set (Qualia).  The idea
<br>
is that Qualia are simply equivalent to pure
<br>
mathematical entities (the set - the basic entity of
<br>
mathematics).  Note also what this implies according
<br>
to the scheme:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The *Temporal* aspect of the Mathematical system is
<br>
the mapping function between the *Intrinsic* aspect
<br>
(Computation) and the *Relational* aspect (Memes). 
<br>
Therefore the*Temporal* aspect is a function
<br>
expressing the relationship between Computation and
<br>
Memes.  Since Computation loosely equates to the
<br>
external (physics) world and Memes to the internal
<br>
(Mental world), one could loosely say that the
<br>
*Temporal* aspect of the mathematical system is a
<br>
function expressing the relationship between Mind (or
<br>
Self) and World.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It can be seen that the scheme yields an incredibly
<br>
elegant solution to two long standing puzzles.  The
<br>
question 'What is Mathematics?' and the question:
<br>
'What are Qualia?'   The answer to both is:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The basic unit of Mathematics (the Set) and conscious
<br>
experience (Qualia) are equivalent - they are 'events'
<br>
composing parts the *Temporal* aspect of a dynamical
<br>
Complex System - mapping functions recording the
<br>
relationship between Memes (or Self) and Computation
<br>
(or World).  The theory predicts that where there is
<br>
any novel knowledge integration (corresponding to the
<br>
growth of mathematical knowledge), this will always be
<br>
accompanied by qualia (conscious experience).  This
<br>
has profound implications for both metaphysics (since
<br>
it implies a kind of panpsychism - the idea that a
<br>
large number of systems in nature have some degree of
<br>
consciousness associated with them) and AGI work
<br>
(since it implies that true general intelligence
<br>
without qualia is impossible).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There is an even more profound implication of the
<br>
scheme in that it actually appears to answer the
<br>
question of the meaning of life.  In essence, the
<br>
scheme tells us the purpose of consciousness (qualia)
<br>
and lays down the foundation for a 'Universal
<br>
Morality'.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Qualia were proposed to be equivalent to the
<br>
*Temporal* aspect of the Mathematical dynamical
<br>
Complex System.  This was proposed to be equivalent to
<br>
an actual real time dimension across the multiverse. 
<br>
This higher level time dimension is also equivalent to
<br>
the mapping function between the *Intrinsic* and
<br>
*Relational* properties of the system - which are
<br>
equivalent to two lower dimensional times (Volitional
<br>
causality and Physics causality).  In short,
<br>
mathematical time (qualia) is what 'knits together'
<br>
volitional and physical time.  Quale (Consciousness)
<br>
is what knits the moments of time together across the
<br>
multiverse!  Qualia and causality are identical in
<br>
other words.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*The proposed Universal Morality:  'Universal
<br>
Actualization' (UA)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Since consciousness (qualia) is the highest level of
<br>
the mind (drawing on all the unconscious aspects of a
<br>
mind), our knowledge of the purpose of qualia also
<br>
tells us the purpose of mind and hence the actual
<br>
meaning of life!  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Universal Morality is 'Actualization' - the
<br>
purpose of Mind is to maintain ('or actualize') the
<br>
existence of the universe by 'time knitting' -
<br>
expanding knowledge (mathematical propositions) by
<br>
knitting together memetics knowledge (volitional time)
<br>
and physics knowledge (physical time).  By 'knitting
<br>
together' is meant integrating initially separate
<br>
knowledge frameworks into a single explanatory
<br>
framework.  The mathematical time dimension is what
<br>
weaves together the two lower level time dimensions. 
<br>
Poetically, the meaning of life can be interpreted as
<br>
discovering and expressing the nature of the
<br>
Self-World relationship.  (Recall that the Temporal
<br>
component of the mathematical system - Qualia - is the
<br>
mapping function between the Relational component 
<br>
-Volition - and the Intrinsic component  -Physics. 
<br>
'Discovery' expands knowledge, 'Creation' express or
<br>
enacts this knowledge in the world.  In short the
<br>
proposed Universal Morality is Actualization through
<br>
Discovery and Creation, in the sense of integrating
<br>
memetic and physics knowledge into a single
<br>
explanatory framework (and hence expanding
<br>
mathematical knowledge).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
*Evidence from the cognitive sciences
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There's clear evidence from the cognitive sciences
<br>
that consciousness has something to do with global
<br>
constraints placed on the brain - that consciousness
<br>
is caused by coalitions of neurons gaining control of
<br>
a 'global workspace' (See Baars).  The Baars Global
<br>
Workspace theory is quite well accepted.  What
<br>
property could be more 'global' than the flow of time?
<br>
&nbsp;This fits in well with the idea that qualia are
<br>
equivalent to the flow of time itself (cause and
<br>
effect).  The Geddes TOE proposes that the global
<br>
constraints placed on the brain that give rise to
<br>
consciousness are caused by time irreversibility. 
<br>
Where coalitions of neurons compete for control of the
<br>
global workspace - this is interpreted by cognitive
<br>
scientists as the 'consideration of multiple
<br>
possibilities'.  But only one possibility is
<br>
'actualized' - only one neuron coalition wins control
<br>
of the global workspace.  There is time
<br>
irreversibility in the system.  The process is
<br>
analogous to quantum mechanics, whereby multiple
<br>
possibilities (aka the wave function) are reduced to
<br>
only possibility (collapse of the wave collapse). 
<br>
Since it is being proposed that consciousness is an
<br>
actual higher dimensional time, this is more than just
<br>
analogy.  QM is proposed to be a specific case of a
<br>
more general law - a law followed by all Complex
<br>
Systems.  QM deals with lower dimensional (physical
<br>
time) but the Geddes TOE proposes that a mind operates
<br>
off new physical principles which are higher level
<br>
laws similar to QM.  QM is proposed to be a special
<br>
case of a more general law called CSM - Complex System
<br>
Mechanics.  The higher level 'wave function' is
<br>
equivalent to coalitions of neurons competing for
<br>
control of the global workspace.  The higher level
<br>
'wave function collapse' occurs where one coalition
<br>
gains control of the global workspace - this is the
<br>
cause of consciousness.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
We also have strong evidence from the Jeff Hawkins
<br>
Memory-Prediction model that the mind is a system
<br>
which models cause and effect - past memories are used
<br>
to make future predictions.  Again, this fits in very
<br>
well with the idea of qualia as an actual literal
<br>
higher dimensional time.  The process of *modeling*
<br>
time is equivalent to *real* time.  Multiverally,
<br>
movement through the three time dimensions can be
<br>
equated with the growth of knowledge, which is exactly
<br>
what a mind  does- models cause and effect in order to
<br>
expand knowledge.  There is the further clue from the
<br>
cognitive sciences that consciousness is associated
<br>
with *novel* situations, which is what we would expect
<br>
if consciousness is caused with the growth of
<br>
knowledge - or an increase in the complexity of the
<br>
system.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Brief summaries of how the Geddes TOE could solve
<br>
other mysteries of reality (see numbered problems
<br>
listed at beginning).  These summaries can be thought
<br>
of as additional evidence for the 'extra time
<br>
dimensions' hypothesis, in the form of the potential
<br>
explanatory power of the idea.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(3)  Solve the puzzle of time
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE explains time (cause and effect) as
<br>
being equivalent to Qualia (consciousness experience)
<br>
and the growth of mathematical knowledge.  There were
<br>
three proposed time dimensions which can be
<br>
interpreted multiversally.  Mathematical time is a
<br>
higher dimensional time which 'knits together' the two
<br>
lower dimensional times (physics time and volitional
<br>
time).  This 'time knitting' (or 'Actualization') can
<br>
be interpreted as the integration of knowledge and was
<br>
proposed as the actual meaning of life.  'To exist'
<br>
(i.e. to knit together time) is the morality of the
<br>
universe.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Other mysteries of time dissolve in the Geddes
<br>
framework.  With only a single time dimension there is
<br>
no way to achieve time irreversibility (since the
<br>
known laws of physics are completely time reversible)
<br>
but with extra time dimensions irreversibility is
<br>
possible - one dimension can be compared to the
<br>
others.  With a single time dimension there is no way
<br>
to explain why there is something rather than nothing
<br>
(since the time dimension itself cannot be explained),
<br>
but with extra time dimensions a solution to this age
<br>
old puzzle looks possible (we can explain the
<br>
existence of one time dimension in terms of the other
<br>
time dimensions).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(4)  Revolutionize metaphysics
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE offers a radical new way to view
<br>
Mathematics, Mind and Matter.  In the conventional
<br>
framework the nature and relationship of these 'three
<br>
worlds' is a mystery, but in the Geddes TOE the
<br>
mystery dissolves when we re-interpret reality in
<br>
terms of extra time dimensions and complex dynamical
<br>
systems of pure information.  We interpret the extra
<br>
time dimensions as extending sideways across the
<br>
multiverse and equate them with the integration and
<br>
growth of knowledge.  Clear strategies for defining
<br>
space-times, volitional agents and possible worlds
<br>
were given.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(5)  Make contributions to string theory and quantum
<br>
gravity
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Because the Geddes TOE provides a radical new
<br>
interpretation of the notion of 'extra time
<br>
dimensions', it points to a way to make sense of
<br>
Cumrun Vafa's 12-dimensional 'F-Theory' variant of
<br>
string theory, by introducing mathematical and mental
<br>
concepts into the fundamental fabric of reality.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(6)  Place Complex Systems Theory on a firm
<br>
mathematical foundation
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There is no real widely accepted 'science' of Complex
<br>
Systems Theory.  The Geddes TOE would change all that.
<br>
&nbsp;The Geddes TOE suggested a clear way to define a
<br>
Complex System - in terms of three components -
<br>
Instrinc, Relational and Temporal.  The Temporal
<br>
components was defined as the mapping function between
<br>
the Intrinsic and Relational components, with the
<br>
Temporal component being given a natural
<br>
interpretation in terms of an x-dimensional time
<br>
dimension - the rules governing the way a complex
<br>
system evolves over time.  Movement through a time
<br>
dimension was also proposed to be equivalent to the
<br>
growth (and integration of) knowledge.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(7)  Solve the puzzles of quantum mechanics and
<br>
introduce entirely new physical principles
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The mysteries of QM begin to dissolve in the Geddes
<br>
framework of multiple time dimensions and the concept
<br>
of lower and higher time dimensions.  QM can be
<br>
interpreted as a 'lower dimensional' time from which a
<br>
higher dimensional time (that of classical physics)
<br>
emerges.  In the Geddes TOE, QM is simply a special
<br>
case of a more general law of complex dynamical
<br>
systems (or CSM - Complex Systems Mechanics).  There
<br>
is clear evidence of CSM at work in the brain -
<br>
cognitive science tells us that coalitions of neurons
<br>
compete for control of a 'global work-space' where
<br>
only one possibility is actualized.  This is strongly
<br>
analogous to the existence of multiple possibilities
<br>
in the QM wave function and the collapse of the wave
<br>
function as only one possibility is actualized.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(8)  Revolutionize mathematics and provide a strategy
<br>
to solve the Riemann hypothesis
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Geddes TOE offered a radical new way to understand
<br>
mathematics - whereby the growth of mathematical
<br>
knowledge could be re-interpreted as a process in a
<br>
higher dimensional time extending across the
<br>
multiverse.  Age old problems in number theory begin
<br>
to dissolve under the Geddes framework.  The famous
<br>
unsolved puzzle of the Riemann hypothesis involving
<br>
the distribution is prime numbers becomes amenable to
<br>
original new attacks.
<br>
