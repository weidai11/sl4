This post is way too lenghthy to respond to line by line, but I think theres 
<br>
enough interesting content here that it warrants a response, even if I'm the 
<br>
only one that thinks so.
<br>
<p>The conceptual framework laid out here (which is really a meta-conceptual 
<br>
framework of three interacting frameworks) is probably better suited to a more 
<br>
limited application than an AGI, such as an interactive storytelling engine. 
<br>
In that context the math, memes, material trichotomy makes sense, as you could 
<br>
imagine an interactive environment being composed of the interaction between 
<br>
those three data-types. The jump from IS engine to AGI is pretty huge, 
<br>
however, if you include the assumption that any model, even a clever 
<br>
meta-model, will break down as it scales out to the entirety of reality.
<br>
<p>I think the concept of multi-dimensional time, while intersting as a 
<br>
metaphore, is built on a faulty premise. If you read Peter Lynd's papers on 
<br>
time and consciousness ( <a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001197/">http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001197/</a> and 
<br>
<a href="http://cogprints.org/3125/">http://cogprints.org/3125/</a> ) you may come to the conclusion that framing these 
<br>
things in terms of time is a way to lose before you've even begun, since the 
<br>
concept of time arose from physical uncertainties associated with our brains' 
<br>
functioning, and is essentially paradoxical.
<br>
<p>As far as volition goes, the assumption that there is a divergence between 
<br>
morality and physicality is also somewhat faulty, if you consider bioquantum 
<br>
views of brain function it would seem that even the mystery of volition can be 
<br>
encompassed by quantum mechanics. Memes, as it were, are not abstract things 
<br>
that are &quot;out-there&quot;, but electrical patterns dependant on material substrates 
<br>
and constrained by the laws of physics.
<br>
<p>I think a good rule of thumb when considering a TOE is that simplicity may 
<br>
just emerge out of one's complex ponderings, and that if you have to describe 
<br>
the universe in elaborate dimensionality, you're probably missing something 
<br>
deeper. Plenty of threads have been devoted to that issue, but its just my 
<br>
intuition in this case.
<br>
<p>As far as the Reimann Hypothesis goes, I'd bet a bottle of wine that quantum 
<br>
gravity theory would come out of an adequate proof, and not the other way 
<br>
around.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, very interesting Marc.

<em>&gt;NEW APPROACH TO AGI!

<em>&gt;UNIVERSAL MORALITY - A NEW PROPOSAL!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;NEW GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR SCIENCE AND PHILOSOPHY!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE could potentially:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(1) Solve the puzzle of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(2) Provide the basis for a 'Universal Morality'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-answer the meaning of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3) Solve the puzzle of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(4) Revolutionize metaphysics by providing a new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understanding of mathematics, mind, matter and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship between the 3
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(5) Provide a strategy for completing string theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and hence achieving a theory of quantum gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(6)  Provide the first firm mathematical framework for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complex systems theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(7)  Solve the puzzles of quantum mechanics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revolutionize science by pointing the way to entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;new non-reductionistic laws of which QM would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;special case
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(8)  Introduce an entirely new understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics which would revolutionize number theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and could lead to a strategy capable of solving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Riemann hypothesis - the deepest problem in pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A statement of the general principles of the TOE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;follows below.  These principles really require a book
</em><br>
<em>&gt;length exposition.  Since this is a posting suitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for message board, what follows is only a very brief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but clear summary.  This is followed by a summary of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how these principles have been applied to problems (1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and (2) named above - the puzzle of consciousness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the universal morality.  There are only very brief
</em><br>
<em>&gt;summaries of how the theory could attack problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3)-(8).  These other problems (not directly relevant
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to AGI work) are touched upon in order to provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence for the potentially explanatory power of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory in order to bolster the case for the proposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;solution to the puzzle of consciousness and Universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;PRINCIPLES OF THE TOE
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(A) 3-dimensional multiversal time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The proposal is that there are 3 time dimensions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is nothing 'mystical' about extra time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensions.  The idea can be given a clear scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation in terms of the multiverse.  One simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imagines extending the extra time dimensions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'sideways' across the multiverse from our current time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;line.  Extra time dimensions have been proposed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several eminent scientists, including cosmologist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Stephen Hawking (Imaginary time) and physicist Cumrun
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Vafa (12-dimensional F-theory variant of string
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory).  Unfortunately however, these proposals have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tended to flounder because there has been no clear way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to interpret the physical meaning of processes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other time dimensions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(B)  3 kinds of causality - Mathematical, Volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE offers a radically new way to interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the meaning of extra time dimensions.  Rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;giving each time dimension a standard physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation, the idea is that there are 3 quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different kinds of causality (cause and effect), each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corresponding a 'movement' through one of the 3 time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(B) i  Mathematical Causality:  The idea here is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret the steps of a mathematical proof as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causal process through a higher time dimension.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;evidence for this is the fact that there exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical entities (for instance Transfinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers, uncomputable and infinitesimals) which cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be fit into ordinary empirical reality.  All entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in ordinary empirical reality are believed to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computable and finite (by the principles of string
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory and the holographic principle) where as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aforementioned mathematical entities are not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(B) ii  Volitional Causality:   The idea here is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret a volitional agent as a series of mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;events defined as a causal process in another time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimension.  The evidence is that when dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mental concepts we appear to be dealing with concepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not easily reducible to fundamental physics.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instance questions of volitional choices are concerned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with morality and decision theory, where as physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions are concerned with prediction.  Of course it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may be that the two classes of concepts are completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent, but if so, why the sharp delineation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the two areas (physics and morality)?  It seems a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural step, following the idea of 'Mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Causality' to postulate an analogous 'Volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Causality' which extends through another time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimension.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(B) iii Functional Causality:  This is the ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physics kind of causality - a physical process of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functional system, or equivalently (by the principle
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of universal computation) a series of computational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We identity three kinds of metaphysical 'worlds' - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathematical, the Volitional and the Physical.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geddes TOE proposes that each of these be interpreted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as an extension in an actual real time dimension
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the multiverse: mathematical causality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corresponds a movement through one time dimension - we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpret this as 'a mathematical proof', volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causality corresponds to a movement through a second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time dimension - we interpret this as 'a meme' , and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functional causality is simply good old ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movement through physics time - we interpret this as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an ordered physical process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(C)  Reality as a complex system of pure information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The idea here dates back to John Wheeler and has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;natural interpretation in terms of modern information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory.  The idea is that we interpret reality from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the point of view of 'Informational Data Structures' -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we pretend that reality is a 'program' or even a sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of 'mind', and treat the things within reality as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'Data' (pure information).  We can then ask what sorts
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Information reality consists of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE proposes that reality is composed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;three interacting 'Complex Systems'.  A complex system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is a system composed of many parts interacting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together in an ordered way, such that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different 'levels of organization' - whereby the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system displays high-level properties not completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predictable in practice from it's low level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;properties, due to strong feed-back from the higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;levels of the system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes definition of 'Complex System' proposes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;define a Complex System as composed of three basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinds of Information:  Intrinsic, Relational and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Temporal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Intrinsic:    The internal states of the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;building blocks (or individual 'parts') of the system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Relational: The relational properties between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;basic building blocks (how a system is put together)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Temporal:  The causal properties of the system -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rules governing how the system evolves across time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The 'Temporal' component of the Complex System needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some basic elaboration in order to understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geddes TOE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The definitions given imply that the '*Temporal*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect of a complex system depends on an ordered
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship (or in mathematical jargon a 'mapping')
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the Intrinsic and Relational aspects.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Temporal =  Mapping (Intrinsic &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Relational)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In order for a system to 'evolve' across time in an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ordered way, there has to be an ordered relationship
</em><br>
<em>&gt;between the Intrinsic and Relational properties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Another way of putting this is that the Temporal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect of the Complex System is a *Function*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Mathematical definition of that terms) mapping the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Intrinsic aspect to the Relational aspects.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'evolution' of the system across time is characterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt;by an increase in the complexity of the system, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE proposes that reality is composed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the following 3 Complex Systems: The Mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;System, The Volitional System and The Physical System.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Definitions of these 3 terms were given earlier.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathematical system consists of *Mathematical proofs*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Volitional system consists of *Memes* and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Physical system consists of *Computations* (Physics).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The above paragraph sounds very strange at first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hearing and requires some elaboration.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;suggested that readers bear in mind the following two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;points below, and then try re-reading the paragraph
</em><br>
<em>&gt;again.  The above paragraph *is* in fact, completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;coherent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Recall that the Geddes TOE proposed three 'time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensions' - one for 'mathematical causality'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(mathematical proofs), one for 'volitional causality'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(memes) and the third for 'functional causality'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(physics).  This offered a way in which Mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entities and Memes could be interpreted as dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems.  In fact, the idea is that each of the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensions be equated with the *Temporal* aspect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the corresponding Complex System.  The *Temporal*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect of the complex system was defined as increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the complexity of the system.  This idea can now be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given an Informational interpretation - as the *growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of knowledge* in an Information System.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Recall that the Geddes TOE proposed to consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reality as 'pure information' (aka John Wheeler).  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are pretending that reality is a 'program' or a kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of 'mind¡¯ and this is what justifies the step of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dividing reality into 'Three Worlds' (Mathematical,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Volitional and Physical).  Whether or not these 'three
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worlds' are reducible to one another is quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irrelevant.  The fact is, that when we treat reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as 'pure information', 3 kinds of fundamental 'data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;types' appear - Mathematical propositions, Memes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Physical states.  We are justified in treating each
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of Information separately because that is what we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to do in order to fully *explain* reality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*informational* terms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When treated in terms of pure information and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered as a Complex System, reality consists of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;three complex systems.  By the definition of a Complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;System given earlier, each system in turn can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sub-divided into 3 parts: Temporal, Intrinsic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Relational, for a total of 9 fundamental kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Information.  The Geddes TOE proposes to 'join' these
</em><br>
<em>&gt;3 Complex Systems together into an integrated whole by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;making two of the complex systems sub-systems of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;last.  Then reality is integrated in an aesthetically
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pleasing way and 9 separate data types are reduced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;7.  The proposal is given below.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The scheme below is intended to be an *Informational*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;representation of Reality.  Reality consists of three
</em><br>
<em>&gt;general types of information - mathematical, memetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and physical.  These are treated as three kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complex system.  The terms *Temporal*, *Relational*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and *Intrinsic* were briefly defined earlier.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;labels below refer to various kinds of proposed data
</em><br>
<em>&gt;structures associated with these components of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathematics System
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Temporal  - Sets (Qualia)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Relational - Memes (Morality)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Intrinsic   -  Space-Time (Physics).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Sets* here refer to the standard mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;definition of the term - groupings of entities related
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in some way.  Everything in math can be defined as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;set of some kind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Memes* is here referring to the Mereological sum (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'collective') of all possible individual volitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Space-Time* is here referring to all possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space-times (i.e. space-times in the multiversal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sense).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The system above is strategy for defining reality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms of 'all possible worlds'.  Clearly, it's a form
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Abstract and Modal realism, since abstract entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are granted distinct ontological existence.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheme proposes to equate the highest level (temporal)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect of reality with mathematical sets - which
</em><br>
<em>&gt;include the space of all possible worlds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The conception of universals here is Aristotelian in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spirit.  Abstract entities are contingent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dependent on having one or more instances.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;radical new step is to define abstract entities as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;processes on a 'Super time-line' (mathematical or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiversal time).  The scheme is closest to David
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lewis's concrete worlds model (CWM), since all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible space-times are granted concrete existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it also has some similarities to the abstract
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worlds model (AWM) of Alvin Plantinga, since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;highest level units of reality  (abstract mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entities) are seen to be constructed from the mapping
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or relationship) between all possible space-times and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all possible volitions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The key thesis of this scheme is that 'consistency'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alone is insufficient to ensure 'existence'.  Because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;abstract entities are defined as events on a 'super
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time-line', the entities have to be connected in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;logical way that goes beyond mere consistency.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposal is that 'Movement' along the mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time-line corresponds to an *integration* of different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kinds of mathematical entity - this shall be called
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'Consilience'.  The Geddes TOE therefore proposes that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical existence requires both *Consistency* and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Consilience*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Volitional System
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Temporal  -  Morality (Memes)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Relational -  Roles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Intrinsic    -  Situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Morality* here refers to a system of memes -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;referring to the generic series of external behaviors
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciously selected by a volitional agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Roles* here refer to the common usage of the term -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the roles volitional agents choose to play (e.g.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Teacher, Doctor)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Situations* are sets of logical activities happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the external world - things happening *to* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volitional agent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The system above is a strategy for defining a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volitional agent.  It says that a volitional agent is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defined by a series of mental events (composed of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memes 'chosen' or 'not chosen' to be acted upon),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which is composed of the relationship between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;roles played by an agent and the situations the agent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;found itself in.  This scheme is part of what could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;called a 'Two Category Theory'.  Ontological reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has been granted to the concept an 'agent', as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distinct from the concept of mere matter.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Forces* here refers to the effect one body has on

<em>&gt;another in terms of physical force

<em>&gt;*Geometry* here refers to the physical states of the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The system above is a strategy for defining a physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space-time (and any sub-set thereof).  It says that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space-time slice is defined as a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;computational events composed of the relationship (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mapping) between the geometrical properties of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spatial continuum and the dynamical properties
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(physical forces).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This is a scheme that really requires a book length
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exposition of terms to be fully comprehensible, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;briefly here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Mathematical system refers to reality as a whole -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the multiverse - including all possible worlds - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any sub-set thereof.    A Volitional system refers to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mental states of a particular volitional agent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And a Physical system refers to the physical states of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a particular space-time - and any sub-set thereof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;These systems can be interpreted multiversally in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms of the three time dimensions proposed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geddes TOE.  The *Temporal* aspect of each system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;corresponds to a time dimension.  For instance looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the Mathematical time dimension in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse would be equivalent to viewing the growth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of mathematical knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Note how all three systems are linked together by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Geddes TOE.  Volitional and Physical systems are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sub-systems of the Mathematical system.  The set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all the *Temporal* aspects of the Volitional systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(i.e. all possible volitions) is the *Relational*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect of the Mathematical system.  And the set of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the *Temporal* aspects of the Physical system (i.e.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all possible space-times) is the *Intrinsic* aspect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Mathematical system.  This should be interpreted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as representing the fact that Mathematics is a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensional time which binds together the two lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensional times (Physics and Morality).  Recall that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the *Temporal* aspect of a Complex System is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mapping function between the *Intrinsic* and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Relational* aspects of the system (see earlier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussion of a complex system).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This completes the (very brief) summary of the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;principles of the Geddes TOE.  Obviously this skeleton
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outline would require a book length exposition to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;qualify as a real theory, but the general principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;outlined are clear, concise and coherent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We shall now outline how these principles could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;applied to solve the puzzle of consciousness (qualia)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and establish the basis for a Universal Morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt;Solving the puzzle of consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Establishing the basis for Universal Morality
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*The nature of Qualia
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The scheme introduced in (C) proposes a solution as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nature of Qualia (consciousness).  Qualia are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposed to be identical (or equivalent) to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Temporal* aspect of the Mathematical system.   Note
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that this was proposed to be: Set (Qualia).  The idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that Qualia are simply equivalent to pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical entities (the set - the basic entity of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics).  Note also what this implies according
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to the scheme:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The *Temporal* aspect of the Mathematical system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mapping function between the *Intrinsic* aspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Computation) and the *Relational* aspect (Memes).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Therefore the*Temporal* aspect is a function
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expressing the relationship between Computation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Memes.  Since Computation loosely equates to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;external (physics) world and Memes to the internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(Mental world), one could loosely say that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Temporal* aspect of the mathematical system is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;function expressing the relationship between Mind (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Self) and World.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It can be seen that the scheme yields an incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elegant solution to two long standing puzzles.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question 'What is Mathematics?' and the question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'What are Qualia?'   The answer to both is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The basic unit of Mathematics (the Set) and conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience (Qualia) are equivalent - they are 'events'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;composing parts the *Temporal* aspect of a dynamical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Complex System - mapping functions recording the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;relationship between Memes (or Self) and Computation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(or World).  The theory predicts that where there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any novel knowledge integration (corresponding to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth of mathematical knowledge), this will always be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;accompanied by qualia (conscious experience).  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has profound implications for both metaphysics (since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it implies a kind of panpsychism - the idea that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;large number of systems in nature have some degree of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness associated with them) and AGI work
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(since it implies that true general intelligence
</em><br>
<em>&gt;without qualia is impossible).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is an even more profound implication of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheme in that it actually appears to answer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question of the meaning of life.  In essence, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scheme tells us the purpose of consciousness (qualia)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and lays down the foundation for a 'Universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Morality'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Qualia were proposed to be equivalent to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Temporal* aspect of the Mathematical dynamical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Complex System.  This was proposed to be equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an actual real time dimension across the multiverse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;This higher level time dimension is also equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mapping function between the *Intrinsic* and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Relational* properties of the system - which are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent to two lower dimensional times (Volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causality and Physics causality).  In short,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical time (qualia) is what 'knits together'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;volitional and physical time.  Quale (Consciousness)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is what knits the moments of time together across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse!  Qualia and causality are identical in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other words.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*The proposed Universal Morality:  'Universal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actualization' (UA)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since consciousness (qualia) is the highest level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the mind (drawing on all the unconscious aspects of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mind), our knowledge of the purpose of qualia also
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tells us the purpose of mind and hence the actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;meaning of life!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Universal Morality is 'Actualization' - the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;purpose of Mind is to maintain ('or actualize') the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence of the universe by 'time knitting' -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expanding knowledge (mathematical propositions) by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knitting together memetics knowledge (volitional time)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and physics knowledge (physical time).  By 'knitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;together' is meant integrating initially separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge frameworks into a single explanatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt;framework.  The mathematical time dimension is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;weaves together the two lower level time dimensions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Poetically, the meaning of life can be interpreted as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discovering and expressing the nature of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Self-World relationship.  (Recall that the Temporal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;component of the mathematical system - Qualia - is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mapping function between the Relational component
</em><br>
<em>&gt;-Volition - and the Intrinsic component  -Physics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'Discovery' expands knowledge, 'Creation' express or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enacts this knowledge in the world.  In short the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposed Universal Morality is Actualization through
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Discovery and Creation, in the sense of integrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;memetic and physics knowledge into a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explanatory framework (and hence expanding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical knowledge).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*Evidence from the cognitive sciences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There's clear evidence from the cognitive sciences
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that consciousness has something to do with global
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constraints placed on the brain - that consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is caused by coalitions of neurons gaining control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a 'global workspace' (See Baars).  The Baars Global
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Workspace theory is quite well accepted.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property could be more 'global' than the flow of time?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This fits in well with the idea that qualia are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent to the flow of time itself (cause and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect).  The Geddes TOE proposes that the global
</em><br>
<em>&gt;constraints placed on the brain that give rise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consciousness are caused by time irreversibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Where coalitions of neurons compete for control of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;global workspace - this is interpreted by cognitive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scientists as the 'consideration of multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibilities'.  But only one possibility is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'actualized' - only one neuron coalition wins control
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the global workspace.  There is time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;irreversibility in the system.  The process is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogous to quantum mechanics, whereby multiple
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibilities (aka the wave function) are reduced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only possibility (collapse of the wave collapse).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Since it is being proposed that consciousness is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actual higher dimensional time, this is more than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogy.  QM is proposed to be a specific case of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more general law - a law followed by all Complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Systems.  QM deals with lower dimensional (physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time) but the Geddes TOE proposes that a mind operates
</em><br>
<em>&gt;off new physical principles which are higher level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laws similar to QM.  QM is proposed to be a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case of a more general law called CSM - Complex System
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mechanics.  The higher level 'wave function' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equivalent to coalitions of neurons competing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control of the global workspace.  The higher level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'wave function collapse' occurs where one coalition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gains control of the global workspace - this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cause of consciousness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We also have strong evidence from the Jeff Hawkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Memory-Prediction model that the mind is a system
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which models cause and effect - past memories are used
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to make future predictions.  Again, this fits in very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;well with the idea of qualia as an actual literal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher dimensional time.  The process of *modeling*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time is equivalent to *real* time.  Multiverally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;movement through the three time dimensions can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;equated with the growth of knowledge, which is exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what a mind  does- models cause and effect in order to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expand knowledge.  There is the further clue from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cognitive sciences that consciousness is associated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with *novel* situations, which is what we would expect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if consciousness is caused with the growth of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge - or an increase in the complexity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Brief summaries of how the Geddes TOE could solve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other mysteries of reality (see numbered problems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;listed at beginning).  These summaries can be thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of as additional evidence for the 'extra time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensions' hypothesis, in the form of the potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt;explanatory power of the idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(3)  Solve the puzzle of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE explains time (cause and effect) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being equivalent to Qualia (consciousness experience)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and the growth of mathematical knowledge.  There were
</em><br>
<em>&gt;three proposed time dimensions which can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpreted multiversally.  Mathematical time is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher dimensional time which 'knits together' the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower dimensional times (physics time and volitional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time).  This 'time knitting' (or 'Actualization') can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be interpreted as the integration of knowledge and was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;proposed as the actual meaning of life.  'To exist'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(i.e. to knit together time) is the morality of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;universe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Other mysteries of time dissolve in the Geddes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;framework.  With only a single time dimension there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no way to achieve time irreversibility (since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;known laws of physics are completely time reversible)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but with extra time dimensions irreversibility is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possible - one dimension can be compared to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others.  With a single time dimension there is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to explain why there is something rather than nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(since the time dimension itself cannot be explained),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but with extra time dimensions a solution to this age
</em><br>
<em>&gt;old puzzle looks possible (we can explain the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;existence of one time dimension in terms of the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time dimensions).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(4)  Revolutionize metaphysics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE offers a radical new way to view
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mathematics, Mind and Matter.  In the conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;framework the nature and relationship of these 'three
</em><br>
<em>&gt;worlds' is a mystery, but in the Geddes TOE the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mystery dissolves when we re-interpret reality in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terms of extra time dimensions and complex dynamical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems of pure information.  We interpret the extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time dimensions as extending sideways across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse and equate them with the integration and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth of knowledge.  Clear strategies for defining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space-times, volitional agents and possible worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were given.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(5)  Make contributions to string theory and quantum
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gravity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Because the Geddes TOE provides a radical new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation of the notion of 'extra time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimensions', it points to a way to make sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cumrun Vafa's 12-dimensional 'F-Theory' variant of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;string theory, by introducing mathematical and mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concepts into the fundamental fabric of reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(6)  Place Complex Systems Theory on a firm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical foundation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is no real widely accepted 'science' of Complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Systems Theory.  The Geddes TOE would change all that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Geddes TOE suggested a clear way to define a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Complex System - in terms of three components -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Instrinc, Relational and Temporal.  The Temporal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;components was defined as the mapping function between
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Intrinsic and Relational components, with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Temporal component being given a natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpretation in terms of an x-dimensional time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimension - the rules governing the way a complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt;system evolves over time.  Movement through a time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dimension was also proposed to be equivalent to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;growth (and integration of) knowledge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(7)  Solve the puzzles of quantum mechanics and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;introduce entirely new physical principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The mysteries of QM begin to dissolve in the Geddes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;framework of multiple time dimensions and the concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of lower and higher time dimensions.  QM can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interpreted as a 'lower dimensional' time from which a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher dimensional time (that of classical physics)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;emerges.  In the Geddes TOE, QM is simply a special
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case of a more general law of complex dynamical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;systems (or CSM - Complex Systems Mechanics).  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is clear evidence of CSM at work in the brain -
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cognitive science tells us that coalitions of neurons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compete for control of a 'global work-space' where
</em><br>
<em>&gt;only one possibility is actualized.  This is strongly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analogous to the existence of multiple possibilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the QM wave function and the collapse of the wave
</em><br>
<em>&gt;function as only one possibility is actualized.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(8)  Revolutionize mathematics and provide a strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to solve the Riemann hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Geddes TOE offered a radical new way to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematics - whereby the growth of mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;knowledge could be re-interpreted as a process in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;higher dimensional time extending across the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;multiverse.  Age old problems in number theory begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to dissolve under the Geddes framework.  The famous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unsolved puzzle of the Riemann hypothesis involving
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the distribution is prime numbers becomes amenable to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original new attacks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
