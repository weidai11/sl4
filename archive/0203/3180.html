Hi all,
<br>
<p>I do not normally forward messages from other lists to this one, but the
<br>
initiative described in the e-mail I'm forwarding here seems particularly
<br>
important, interesting, and pertinent.
<br>
<p>Billionaire George Soros has initiated a movement aimed at securing free
<br>
Internet access to scientific research papers for all people in the world.
<br>
<p>I think this is an important initiative, and one that can potentially play a
<br>
significant role in helping to accelerate the Singularity.  As scientists
<br>
freely donate their research to the world, the world should have free access
<br>
to it.  Right now many researchers in the Third World have only erratic
<br>
access to internationally generated research results, and this is wrong.
<br>
<p>Of course, I realize that Soros's (and my) point of view may grate against
<br>
some of the more libertarian members of this list.  But I'm guessing, not
<br>
too badly.  The scientific journals that charge $$ for subscriptions are
<br>
basically just leeches off the scientific community at the moment.
<br>
Scientists write papers, scientists referee them; all the journals do is
<br>
print them and change money for them.  The journals persist because of
<br>
cultural inertia: scientific reputation is made via publication in
<br>
well-known journals.  Instead, universities should each contribute a small
<br>
amount of money to professional organizations like the Americal Physical
<br>
Society, the Association for Computing Machinery, etc.  The journals run by
<br>
these organizations should create print-outs of scientific papers only for
<br>
archival purposes, and their main function should be to produce websites
<br>
containing peer-reviewed research.
<br>
<p>Soros's involvement here is an interesting example of tech-era philanthropy.
<br>
Soros is just one of many modern philanthropists doing interesting and
<br>
unconventional things with their money.  The Gates Foundation has recently
<br>
announced a $40M initiative to create high-school/colleges where students
<br>
receive their AA degrees along with their high school diplomas (not an
<br>
original idea; Simon's Rock College, where I attended, recently opened a
<br>
high school of this nature in New York).  John Templeton created a
<br>
foundation a few years ago, aimed at funding research on the connection
<br>
between science and spiritual experience.  Etc.  Maybe one of these rich
<br>
dudes will decide to fund Singularity-oriented R&amp;D, one of these years...!

Subject: Budapest Open Access Initiative
<br>
<p><p>This message is addressed to CogPrints users and concerns the Budapest
<br>
Open Access Initiative (BOAI) <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess">http://www.soros.org/openaccess</a> launched
<br>
on 14 February by George Soros's Open Society Institute.
<br>
<p>To be useful, research must be used. To be used (read, cited, applied,
<br>
extended) it must be accessible. There are currently 20,000
<br>
peer-reviewed journals of scientific and scholarly research worldwide,
<br>
publishing over 2 million articles per year, every single one of them
<br>
given away for free by its researcher-authors and their
<br>
research-institutions, with the sole goal of maximizing their uptake and
<br>
usage by further researchers, and hence their impact on worldwide
<br>
research, to the benefit of learning and of humanity.
<br>
<p>Yet access to those 2 million annual research articles can only be had
<br>
for a fee. Hence they are accessible only to the lucky researchers at
<br>
that minority of the world's research institutions that can pay for
<br>
them. And even the wealthiest of these institutions can only afford a
<br>
small and shrinking proportion of those annual 20,000 journals.  The
<br>
result is exactly as if all those 2 million articles had been written
<br>
for royalties or fees, just the way most of the normal literature is
<br>
written, rather than having been given away for free by their authors
<br>
and their institutions for the benefit of research and humanity.
<br>
<p>As a consequence, other researchers' access to all this work, and hence
<br>
its potential impact on and benefit to research progress, is being
<br>
minimized by access tolls that most research institutions and
<br>
individuals worldwide cannot afford to pay.
<br>
<p>Those access tolls were necessary, and hence justified, in the Gutenberg
<br>
era of print-on-paper, with its huge real costs, and no alternatives.
<br>
But they are no longer necessary or justified, and are instead in direct
<br>
conflict with what is best for research, researchers, and society, in
<br>
today's PostGutenberg era of on-line-eprints, when virtually all of
<br>
those Gutenberg costs have vanished, and those remaining costs can be
<br>
covered in a way that allows open access.
<br>
<p>The Budapest Open Access Initiative is dedicated to freeing online
<br>
access to this all-important but anomalous (because give-away)
<br>
literature, now that open access has at long last become possible, by
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I) providing universities with the means of freeing online access
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to their own annual peer-reviewed research output (as published in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the 20,000 established journals) through institutional
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-archiving,
<br>
<p>as well as by
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(II) providing support for new alternative journals that offer open
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;online access to their full text contents directly (and for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;established journals that are committed to making the transition to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offering open full-text access online).
<br>
<p>It is entirely fitting that it should be George Soros's Open Society
<br>
Institute that launches this initiative to open access to the world's
<br>
refereed research literature at last. Open access is now accessible,
<br>
indeed already overdue, at a mounting cost in lost benefits to research
<br>
and to society while we delay implementing it. What better way to open
<br>
society than to open access to the fruits of its science and
<br>
scholarship, already freely donated by its creators, but until now not
<br>
freely accessible to all of its potential users? Fitting too is the fact
<br>
that this initiative should originate from a part of the world that has
<br>
known all too long and all too well the privations of a closed society
<br>
and access denial.
<br>
<p>Please have a look at the BOAI at <a href="http://www.soros.org/openaccess">http://www.soros.org/openaccess</a> and,
<br>
if you or your organization are implementing, or planning to implement
<br>
either Strategy I or Strategy II, I hope you will sign the BOAI, either
<br>
as an individual or an organization. Over 100 organizations and 1500
<br>
individuals worldwide have indicated their commitment already.
<br>
<p>Below, are links to some of the press coverage of the BOAI so far.
<br>
<p>Best wishes,
<br>
