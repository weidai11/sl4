Yes.  ACCEPTING mortality.  I don't expect love or even rationality.  In fact, I don't expect any response.  What good is there in outliving all the stars in the universe?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an infinite holonic depth to knowledge. The question is: &quot;What is useful within the boundary and constraints of quasi-finite existence?&quot;  I personally accept that my particular energy pattern which constitutes &quot;me-ness&quot; is replicable given time, space, physics, and evolution, etc. And that I may not be the first organization of &quot;me&quot; in time given the combinatorial possibilites over an infinite expanse.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Should our goal be infinite transcendence or humility in quasi-finite beingness.  That question seems to be a critical underlying theme to the singularity movement and its opponents.  I don't need to be an infinite transcendent being unto myself when I accept that I am already a finite aspect of an infinitely transcendent being whose modality will reoccur in an infinite manner across an infinite expanse of space and time.  Would it matter if I can not recall or have an awareness of everytime my specific pattern of energy evolved into being?  I don't have perfect recollection of every moment I have experienced in this particular evolution!  But being that energy can neither be created nor destroyed but changes phase states, there is a recombinant certainty that over the expanse of infinite time or infinitely parallel time that my energy pattern will repeat itself just like any prime aspect of an infinite continuum.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I am simply comfortable with being a prime aspect of consciousness with the certainty of replication at some distant and/or past point in time with an infinite potential of replication.  Hence 'death' as we perceive it is a discrete step in a continual (i.e. not continuous) manifestation of being.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a limit to our transcendent status?  Would having the ability to create or destroy universes at whim be enough to satisfy our egos?  Is there a limit to perceivable awareness, i.e. at what point in the holon of the mandelbrot set does the picture become inperceivable or just plain useless?  Can I be happy with a knowledge of how to live in complete harmony with absolute chaos?  Or maybe limited harmony with limited chaos? How much is enough?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I keep repeating the question in different ways because I want to be clear to most anyone capable of understanding that the people on this list are capable, within my estimation, of realizing a technologically limitless future where our transcendent power would be near limitless; but to what end?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I could create or destroy universes at will, that still would not make me G-d.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Extremely intelligent-- yes.  Extremely powerful -- yes.  But still not G-d.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The best answer that I can come up with for justifying infinite transcendence is that it would be fun!  What other purpose is there once you've crossed the boundary of all necessity?
<br>

<em>&gt;Apparantly, we are already benefitting from limited AI. I am am cautious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in my promotion of a fully self-conscious strong AI. The necessity of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having a being like that amongst us is dubious at best. The probability of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this potential becoming a reality increases at least geometrically and most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely exponentially with our increased intellectual capacity and knowledge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;base. The argument for a strong AI seems very similar to the argument for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a nuclear weapon...the first country to have one would have an incredible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advantage over others in at least a superficial political sense. Humans are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;often irrational and this kind of motivation could lead to a strong AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;'arms race'. Sane people would want FAI simply to reduce to existential 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;risk such a being would pose to us; but people often act on emotion and not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Creating an uncontrollable being who's intelligence is beyond ours to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the nth degree is what many are forecasting to be our future reality. We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already have a G-d whom we can't understand or control. Why do we need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;another one? Wouldn't it be better just to build better tools and better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methods for developing rational, moral human beings, and accepting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mortality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I keep returning to the same thought...&quot;Someone will succeed in this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;endeavor at some point in my lifetime, my children's lifetime or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;grandchildren's lifetime.&quot; Therefore, we must build an invariant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mathematical model of friendly behaviour before we build a mind capable of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;destroying us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we could build such a model of behaviour and methods of instilling 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this model in humans then what would we really need an FAI for? The answer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to be that we need insurance against an unfriendly AI.
